;;; XXX: To set this up:
;;;
;;; 1. symlink from this file to ~/.emacs
;;; 2. symlink from the public Emacs configuration area to ~/.emacs.d
;;;
;;; That gives the following benefits:
;;;
;;; 1. Emacs does not create an ~/.emacs.d which only contains an
;;;    auto-save-list.
;;; 2. The setup is clearly visible in ~/.emacs.d, though it is cleanly
;;;    maintained elsewhere (probably under a dotfiles checkout).
;;; 3. Runtime and disposable junk is placed in ~/.emacs.d/user, most of which
;;;    can be safely .gitignored.
;;; 4. Packages are placed in ~/.emacs.d/elpa.
