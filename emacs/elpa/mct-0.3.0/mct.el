  "Control auto-display and live-update of Completions' buffer.

When nil, the user has to manually request completions, using the
regular activating commands.  The Completions' buffer is never
updated live to match user input.  Updating has to be handled
manually.  This is like the out-of-the-box minibuffer completion
experience.

When set to the value `visible', the Completions' buffer is live
updated only if it is visible.  The actual display of the
completions is still handled manually.  For this reason, the
`visible' style does not read the `mct-minimum-input', meaning
that it will always try to live update the visible completions,
regardless of input length.

When non-nil (the default), the Completions' buffer is
automatically displayed once the `mct-minimum-input' is met and
is hidden if the input drops below that threshold.  While
visible, the buffer is updated live to match the user input.

Note that every function in the `mct-completion-passlist' ignores
this option altogether.  This means that every such command will
always show the Completions' buffer automatically and will always
update its contents live.  Same principle for every function
declared in the `mct-completion-blocklist', which will always
disable both the automatic display and live updating of the
Completions' buffer."
