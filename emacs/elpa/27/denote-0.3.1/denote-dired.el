;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Denote's file-naming scheme is not specific to notes or text files:
;; it is useful for all sorts of files, such as multimedia and PDFs that
;; form part of the user's longer-term storage (read manual's "The
;; file-naming scheme").  While Denote does not manage such files, it
;; already has all the mechanisms to facilitate the task of renaming
;; them.
;;
;; To this end, we provide the `denote-dired-rename-file' command.  It
;; has a two-fold purpose: (i) to change the name of an existing file
;; while retaining its identifier and (ii) to write a Denote-compliant
;; file name for an item that was not created by `denote' or related
;; commands (such as an image or PDF).
;;
;; The `denote-dired-rename-file' command will target the file at point
;; if it finds one in the current Dired buffer.  Otherwise it prompts
;; with minibuffer completion for a file name.  It then uses the
;; familiar prompts for a `TITLE' and `KEYWORDS' the same way the
;; `denote' command does (read manual's "Points of entry).  As a final
;; step, it asks for confirmation before renaming the file at point,
;; showing a message like:
;;
;;     Rename sample.pdf to 20220612T052900--my-sample-title__testing.pdf? (y or n)
;;
;; However, if the user option `denote-dired-rename-expert' is non-nil,
;; conduct the renaming operation outright---no questions asked.
;;
;; When operating on a file that has no identifier, such as
;; `sample.pdf', Denote reads the file properties to retrieve its last
;; modification time.  If the file was from a past date like 2000-11-31
;; it will get an identifier starting with `20001131' followed by the
;; time component (per our file-naming scheme).
;;
;; The file type extension (e.g. `.pdf') is read from the underlying
;; file and is preserved through the renaming process.  Files that have
;; no extension are simply left without one.
;;
;; Renaming only occurs relative to the current directory.  Files are not
;; moved between directories.
;;
;; The final step of the `denote-dired-rename-file' command is to call
;; the special hook `denote-dired-post-rename-functions'.  Functions
;; added to that hook must accept three arguments, as explained in its
;; doc string.  For the time being, the only function we define is the
;; one which updates the underlying note's front matter to match the new
;; file name: `denote-dired-rewrite-front-matter'.  The function takes
;; care to only operate on an actual note, instead of arbitrary files.
;;
;; DEVELOPMENT NOTE: the `denote-dired-rewrite-front-matter' needs to be
;; tested thoroughly.  It rewrites file contents so we have to be sure
;; it does the right thing.  To avoid any trouble, it always asks for
;; confirmation before performing the replacement.  This confirmation
;; ignores `denote-dired-rename-expert' for the time being, though we
;; might want to lift that restriction once everything works as
;; intended.
;;
;;
;; One of the upsides of Denote's file-naming scheme is the predictable
;; pattern it establishes, which appears as a near-tabular presentation in
;; a listing of notes (i.e. in Dired).  The `denote-dired-mode' can help
;; enhance this impression, by fontifying the components of the file name
;; to make the date (identifier) and keywords stand out.
;;
;; There are two ways to set the mode.  Either use it for all directories,
;; which probably is not needed:
;;
;;     (require 'denote-dired)
;;     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode)
;;
;; Or configure the user option `denote-dired-directories' and then set up
;; the function `denote-dired-mode-in-directories':
;;
;;     (require 'denote-dired)
;;
;;     ;; We use different ways to specify a path for demo purposes.
;;     (setq denote-dired-directories
;;           (list denote-directory
;;                 (thread-last denote-directory (expand-file-name "attachments"))
;;                 (expand-file-name "~/Documents/vlog")))
;;
;;     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode-in-directories)
;;
;; The `denote-dired-mode' does not only fontify note files that were
;; created by Denote: it covers every file name that follows our naming
;; conventions (read about "The file-naming scheme" in the manual).
;; This is particularly useful for scenaria where, say, one wants to
;; organise their collection of PDFs and multimedia in a systematic way
;; (and, perhaps, use them as attachments for the notes Denote
;; produces).
;;
;; For the time being, the `diredfl' package is not compatible with this
;; facility.
