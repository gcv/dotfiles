Non-nil if Fountain-Completion-Auto-Update mode is enabled.
See the `fountain-completion-auto-update-mode' command

either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')

Updates `fountain-mode' completion candidates when idle.

Calls `fountain-completion-update' in `fountain-mode' buffers
after `fountain-completion-auto-update-delay'.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Fountain-Completion-Auto-Update mode' mode.  If the prefix
argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or
negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value
\\='fountain-completion-auto-update-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
