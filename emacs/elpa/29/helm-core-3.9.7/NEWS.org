** Version 3.9.5

*** Add compatibility with Emacs-28< for helm-packages

Tested with emacs-27.

*** Add new action package-isolate for helm-packages

Allow launching a new Emacs with only package(s).

*** Packages list can be refreshed with C-c C-u

Themes, colors etc...

This allow using completions-detailed in Emacs-27 with various
describe-* functions.

*** Helm-occur now doesn't hang when trying to match empty lines

With "^$".

*** Highlight matches in M-x highlight only commands

I.e. Items in short documentation are not highlighted.

** Version 3.9.4

*** Add two new alists to allow extending completions-detailed

This allows providing detailed completions in more places, see
`helm-completing-read-extra-metadata` and
`helm-completing-read-command-categories`.
They are not provided as user variables as it may be tricky to provide
the corresponding affixations functions.
As of now we have detailed completions in
describe-function/variable/symbol/command/package,
find-function/variable, switch-to-buffer,
customize-variable/group, package-(vc)install, package-vc-checkout.

*** New helm packages manager

The old helm-elisp-package has been replaced by helm-packages.
The old one was too slow, taking lot of memory and even crashing Emacs
especially with last Emacs-29.

** Version 3.9.3

*** Ensure to use affixation functions provided by caller in helm-mode

** Version 3.9.2

*** New progress bar for Rsync action from helm-find-files

*** Use Wfnames package as dependency to replace Wdired

** Version 3.9.1

*** helm-config file has been removed

Therefore (require 'helm-config) will return an error, don't use this
anymore. If installing from source use instead (require 'helm-autoloads), otherwise from a package install, the autoloads file
will be automatically loaded.


*** Allow using helm-completion-styles-alist by command

*** New mode for editing large vars

Will be used automatically when using the set variable action from
helm-apropos.

*** Improve all-the-icons in many places
