#lang racket/base

;; This module acts as a "shim" or "launcher" for command-server.rkt.
;;
;; We dynamic-require command-server.rkt within an exn handler for
;; missing modules, to provide a better error UX when people are using
;; Minimal Racket; see issue #744. Any such error is written to stdout
;; as a "notification" for the Emacs front end, which can display it
;; in a dedicated buffer. Not only is this better than error text
;; flashing by in the echo bar and hiding in the *Messages* buffer,
;; our dedicated can supply a browse-url button to our docs section
;; about Minimal Racket.
;;
;; Note that the exn handler is active only during the dynamic extent
;; of the dynamic-require to extract the command-server-loop function.
;; Subsequently we call that function without any such handler in
;; effect.
;;
;; Use the same notification mechanism for other back end startup
;; failures, such as when they need a newer version of Racket.

;; Limit imports to those supplied by Minimal Racket!
