                 DEVDOCS.EL — EMACS VIEWER FOR DEVDOCS
                ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


devdocs.el is a documentation viewer for Emacs similar to the built-in
Info browser, but geared towards documentation distributed by the
[DevDocs] website.  Currently, this covers over 500 versions of 188
different software components.

The stable version of the package is available from [GNU ELPA] and a
development version is available from [MELPA]; to install, type `M-x
package-install RET devdocs'.

1 Basic usage
═════════════

  To get started, download some documentation with `M-x
  devdocs-install'.  This will query <https://devdocs.io> for the
  available documents and save the selected one to disk.  To read the
  installed documentation, there are two options:

  • `devdocs-peruse': Select a document and display its first page.
  • `devdocs-lookup': Select an index entry and display it.

  It's handy to have a keybinding for the latter command.  One
  possibility, in analogy to `C-h S' (`info-lookup-symbol'), is

  ┌────
  │ (global-set-key (kbd "C-h D") 'devdocs-lookup)
  └────

  In any given buffer, the first call to `devdocs-lookup' will query for
  a list of documents to search (you can select more than one option by
  entering a comma-separated list).  This selection will be remembered
  in subsequent calls to `devdocs-lookup', unless a prefix argument is
  given; in this case you can select a new list of documents.

  In the `*devdocs*' buffer, navigation keys similar to Info and
  `*Help*' buffers are available; press `C-h m' for details.  Internal
  hyperlinks are opened in the same viewing buffer, and external links
  are opened as `browse-url' normally would.


2 Managing documents
════════════════════

  To manage the collection of installed documents, use the following
  commands:

  • `devdocs-install': Download and install (or reinstall) a document
    distributed by <https://devdocs.io>.
  • `devdocs-delete': Remove an installed document.
  • `devdocs-update-all': Download and reinstall all installed documents
    for which a newer version is available.

  In some cases, variants of a document are available for each (major)
  version.  It is possible to install several versions in parallel.

  Documents are installed under `devdocs-data-dir', which defaults to
  `~/.emacs.d/devdocs'.  To completely uninstall the package, remove
  this directory.


3 Setting the default documents for a collection of buffers
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  You may wish to select a predefined list of documents in all buffers
  of a certain major mode or project.  To achieve this, set the
  `devdocs-current-docs' variable directly, say via [dir-local
  variables] or a mode hook:

  ┌────
  │ (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
  │ 	  (lambda () (setq-local devdocs-current-docs '("python~3.9"))))
  └────

  As usual, calling `devdocs-lookup' with a prefix argument redefines
  the selected documents for that specific buffer.
