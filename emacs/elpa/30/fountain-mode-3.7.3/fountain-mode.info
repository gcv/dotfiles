Fountain Mode
*************

Fountain Mode is a screenwriting (and playwriting) program for GNU Emacs
version 24.4 or later.  The Fountain markup format is a plain-text
format designed to be easily readable and editable, portable and
future-proof, and to look as much like a script as possible.

   This is the Fountain Mode Manual updated for version 3.7.

   The public Fountain Mode code repository is hosted on GitHub
(https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode).

Overview
********

Fountain Mode combines the simplicity of Fountain syntax with the
extensibility of Emacs.  Fountain Mode is a major mode for Emacs, which
is to say it is a program that runs inside Emacs -- the extensible,
customizable, free/libre text editor.  It enables the writer to engage
with all aspects of realizing a screenplay -- story development,
outlining, drafting, and rewriting.

   To quickly get up to speed with Fountain syntax, memorize the syntax
for the six most used elements of the screenplay format: *note Scene
Headings::, *note Action::, *note Characters::, *note Dialogue::, *note
Parentheticals::, and *note Transitions::.

   Then learn how to outline a script.  *Note Section Headings::.  This
will be familiar for anyone who has used Markdown, as the syntax is the
same.  Sections allow you to easily show or hide and reorder large parts
of a script.

   There are additional Fountain syntax elements to allow for
brainstorming, capturing ideas and omitting a part of the script without
deleting it.  *Note Synopses::, *note Notes::, and *note Comments::.
These elements are not usually included in the formatted output.

   All of Fountain Mode's capabilities are accessible via the menu, and
all customization is performed via the 'Fountain' option group.  *Note
(emacs) Customization Groups::.

Installation
************

The latest stable release of Fountain Mode is available as an Emacs
package via MELPA-stable (https://stable.melpa.org/#/fountain-mode).

   In order to install packages via MELPA-stable, you'll first need to
add it to your package archives:

     M-x customize-option RET package-archives RET

   Insert an entry named 'melpa-stable' with the URL
'https://stable.melpa.org/packages/'

   You can then find the latest stable version of 'fountain-mode' in the
list returned by:

     M-x list-packages RET

   If you like to live on the bleeding edge and prefer the latest but
perhaps unstable version, do the above using MELPA
(https://melpa.org/#/fountain-mode).  Unless you are already familiar
with debugging Elisp code, it is strongly encouraged to use the stable
version.

Requirements
============

Fountain Mode is compatible with Emacs version 24.4 and later.

   For Emacs versions older than 26.1, there is a bug in the 'outline'
library.  This will be automatically patched provided
'fountain-patch-emacs-bugs' is non-nil and Emacs is installed with its
Elisp source files.

   For Emacs versions older than 25.1, the 'seq' library will need to be
installed; if you install using the Emacs package management system,
'seq' will be installed automatically.

Script Elements
***************

The central idea of writing a script in Fountain is that you should be
able to just start writing -- as long as your text looks like a script,
you should get correctly formatted output.

     n.b.: Fountain Mode uses the Fountain 1.1 syntax specification.
     While some programs use custom additions to the specification, for
     the greatest cross-compatibility, stick with the 1.1 spec.

* Menu:

* Metadata::			Key-value info at the top of your script.
* Section Headings::		Outline your script with '#'-prefixed headings.
* Scene Headings::		Lines beginning with 'INT', 'EXT', etc.
* Action::			Anything that's not another element.
* Characters::			Names are in ALL-CAPS.
* Dialogue::			Text following character elements.
* Parentheticals::		Text inside (parens) within dialogue.
* Transitions::			Uppercase lines ending in 'TO:'.
* Notes::			Text within '[[' double brackets ']]'.
* Synopses::			Lines beginning with '='.
* Center Text::			Put your titles '>' between these '<'.
* Comments::			C-style multi-line comments (aka "Boneyard").


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Metadata,  Next: Section Headings,  Up: Script Elements

Metadata
========

A Fountain script usually starts with some metadata stating the basic
information about the script.  These are colon-separated key-value pairs
at the start of a file:

     key: value

   Other Fountain-compatible programs may refer to this as "title page"
info, but metadata can store information not related to or present on
the title page.

   Calling 'auto-insert' will guide you through adding the most common
Fountain metadata, prompting with likely defaults:

   * 'title' is pretty obvious, and will default to base-name of the
     current buffer.
   * 'credit' is not actually your name, but the type of credit given to
     the 'author', e.g.  'written by' or 'screenplay by'.
   * 'author' is you or your writing team, and defaults to the value of
     variable 'user-full-name'.
   * 'format' will override the value of
     'fountain-default-script-format' for the current script.  Accepted
     values are: 'screenplay', 'teleplay', 'stageplay'.
   * 'date' defaults to the current date in your locale's "preferred"
     format.
   * 'source', for if you're writing an adaptation.
   * 'contact' is useful if the writer wants readers to ever get in
     touch to make the film/play!

   All metadata keys can take either a single line of input following
the colon, or a newline followed multiple lines indented with
whitespace:

     author:
     	Mary Maryland
     	and
     	Alan Smithee

   Metadata keys are case-insensitive, e.g.  'Title' is the same as
'title'.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Section Headings,  Next: Scene Headings,  Prev: Metadata,  Up: Script Elements

Section Headings
================

Section headings are lines beginning with '#' (number sign).  There are
five levels of section headings, with additional '#' characters demoting
the outline level of a heading.

     # Top-Level Heading

     ## Sub-Heading

     ### Sub-Sub-Heading

   *Note Outlining::.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Scene Headings,  Next: Action,  Prev: Section Headings,  Up: Script Elements

Scene Headings
==============

Scene headings begin with a prefix, specified in
'fountain-scene-heading-prefix-list', which defaults to:

     INT, EXT, EST, INT./EXT., INT/EXT, I/E

   Each prefix may be followed by a dot and/or a space, so the following
are equivalent:

     INT HOUSE - DAY

     INT. HOUSE - DAY

 -- User Option: fountain-scene-heading-prefix-list
     This options allows setting your own scene heading prefixes.  These
     entries are case-insensitive.

 -- User Option: fountain-scene-heading-suffix-list
     This options allows setting your own scene heading suffixes (or
     time-of-day).  These entries are case-insensitive.

 -- User Option: fountain-scene-heading-suffix-separator
     This option allows setting the separator (a regular expression)
     between the scene location and time of day.  The default ' --? '
     allows either one or two dashes.

 -- User Option: fountain-auto-upcase-scene-headings
     Enabling this option will automatically upcase text after a scene
     heading prefix as you type.

 -- User Option: fountain-double-space-scene-headings
     Enabling this option will display two blank lines above scene
     headings, regardless of what's in the file.  n.b.  This option does
     not affect calculation of pagination.

   *Note Scene Heading Completion::.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Action,  Next: Characters,  Prev: Scene Headings,  Up: Script Elements

Action
======

Action is the easiest Fountain element -- anything that isn't parsed as
another element is considered action.

   Sometimes you may write some action that will be unintentionally
parsed as dialogue, for example:

     Jack examines his shopping list...

     BLACK SHIRT
     BLACK PANTS
     EXPLOSIVES
     MAP

   Here 'BLACK SHIRT' would be parsed as a character, who then shouts
"BLACK PANTS!..." We don't want that.  To prevent this, prefix the first
line with '!' (exclamation mark).  This is known as a "forced" element.

     !BLACK SHIRT
     BLACK PANTS
     EXPLOSIVES
     MAP


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Characters,  Next: Dialogue,  Prev: Action,  Up: Script Elements

Characters
==========

To write a character name to cue some dialogue, type the name in
uppercase (ALL-CAPS).

     JOLENE

   The next line will be parsed as dialogue.

   Sometimes you might want to include lowercase letters in a character
name.  To force a line as a character name, prefix it with '@' (at
sign).

     @JOLENE McCLOGGS

   Some Fountain tools may not parse a line as a character name if the
extension contains lowercase letters, requiring the '@' prefix.

     @JOLENE (cont'd)

   If you are just writing the character's name within action, type the
character's name normally.

     Jolene

   If you prefer to write character names within action in uppercase,
that's fine too.  The following will still be parsed as action.

     JOLENE throws the chair at PHILIP.

 -- User Option: fountain-character-extension-list
     This option allows setting your own character extensions, e.g.
     "(O.C.)".

   *Note Character Name Completion::.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Dialogue,  Next: Parentheticals,  Prev: Characters,  Up: Script Elements

Dialogue
========

Dialogue is any text following *note Characters::.  Just enter a newline
and the next text entered will be parsed as dialogue.

     JOLENE
     Have you seen trouble? I seem to have misplaced it.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Parentheticals,  Next: Transitions,  Prev: Dialogue,  Up: Script Elements

Parentheticals
==============

Any text inside parentheticals and within dialogue is parsed as a
parenthetical element, e.g.

     JOLENE
     (concerned)
     Have you seen trouble? I seem to have misplaced it.

   *Note Autocompletion::.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Transitions,  Next: Notes,  Prev: Parentheticals,  Up: Script Elements

Transitions
===========

A transition is any line ending with 'TO:', or you can force a
transition by prefixing it with '>'.

 -- User Option: fountain-trans-suffix-list
     This option allows setting your own transition suffixes, so that
     lines ending in these will be parsed as transitions.  These entries
     are case-insensitive.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Notes,  Next: Synopses,  Prev: Transitions,  Up: Script Elements

Notes
=====

Text enclosed in '[[ ]]' (double brackets) is parsed as a note, and is
generally not included in export.  Use these for keeping draft notes,
research, feedback, etc.

'C-c C-z'
     This will insert a note based on 'fountain-note-template' (see
     below) beneath the current element, or if the region is active,
     surround the region with note delimiters ('fountain-insert-note').

 -- User Option: fountain-note-template
     Template for inserting a new note.  Passed to 'format-spec' with
     the following specification:

        * '%u user-login-name'
        * '%n user-full-name'
        * '%e user-mail-address'
        * '%x' date in locale’s preferred format
        * '%F' date in ISO format
        * '%P' leave point here

     The default '%P - %n %x' inserts something like:

          [[ | - Alan Smithee 12/31/2017 ]]"


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Synopses,  Next: Center Text,  Prev: Notes,  Up: Script Elements

Synopses
========

A synopsis is a handy way to detail what a scene or section is about.  A
synopsis element is simply a line beginning with '=' (equals sign).

     INT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY
     = The men eat the shark they caught.

   Synopses are not included by most export tools.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Center Text,  Next: Comments,  Prev: Synopses,  Up: Script Elements

Center Text
===========

Any text surrounded with '>' and '<' (greater and less than signs) will
be centered in output, e.g.:

     > Once Upon a Time... <


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Comments,  Prev: Center Text,  Up: Script Elements

Comments
========

Text that are in C-style comments, /* like this */, is not exported by
export tools.  It's text that's "in the boneyard".  Unlike other
Fountain syntax, these comments can span newlines and other formatting;
structurally, it's as if the text were removed.

   This "boneyard" is for text that you're on the brink of removing, or
drafts that you aren't ready to "uncomment" and include yet, or just
anything else you want to ignore.

   If you instead just want to annotate your screenplay, *note Notes::
or *note Synopses::.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Outlining,  Next: Navigation,  Prev: Script Elements,  Up: Top

Outlining
*********

Acts and sequences can be given meaningful section titles, giving you an
overview of the story structure.

   There are five levels of section headings.  Scene headings count as
the sixth level headings.

   Cycle an individual subtree visibility with 'TAB'.  Cycle global
outline visibility with 'S-TAB' (shift-tab) or 'C-u TAB'.

 -- Command: fountain-insert-section-heading
     Bound to 'M-RET', insert an empty section heading at the current
     outline level.

 -- Command: fountain-outline-to-indirect-buffer
     If you want to focus on discrete sections of your script you can
     open these in indirect buffers.  Bound to 'C-c C-x b', this command
     clones the current section or scene to indirect buffer.

     *Note (emacs) Indirect Buffers::

 -- User Option: fountain-pop-up-indirect-windows
     Set this to control how indirect buffer windows are opened.
     Sometimes you might want to limit your focus to one sequence, other
     times you might want to look at two scenes in windows side-by-side.
     Set this option to spawn a new window.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Navigation,  Next: Syntax Highlighting,  Prev: Outlining,  Up: Top

Navigation
**********

Because a Fountain script is structured text, there are plenty of ways
to quickly move to where you want to be.

'C-M-n'
     Move to the next visible scene or section heading
     ('fountain-outline-next').

'C-M-p'
     Move to the previous visible scene or section heading
     ('fountain-outline-previous').

'C-M-f'
     Move forward to the next visible scene or section heading at same
     outline level ('fountain-outline-forward')

'C-M-b'
     Move backward to the previous visible scene or section heading at
     the same outline level ('fountain-outline-backward').

'C-M-a'
     Move to the beginning of the current scene or section
     ('fountain-outline-beginning').

'C-M-u'
     Move up to the parent section heading ('fountain-outline-up').

'M-n'
     Move to next character name ('fountain-forward-character').

'M-p'
     Move to previous character name ('fountain-backward-character').

'C-x ]'
     Move to next page.  This command does not move by one page but
     actually moves to the next page-break point in the text pagination
     properties ('fountain-forward-page').

'C-x ['
     Move to previous page ('fountain-backward-page').

'M-g s'
     Prompt for a scene number string and move to the specified scene.
     If scenes are numbered, this command will take you to the scene
     matching that string, otherwise it will count the scenes from
     beginning of the accessible buffer, recalculating when encountering
     a numbered scene ('fountain-goto-scene').

'M-g p'
     Prompt for a number and move to the specified page.  This command
     does not actually count pages but uses the text pagination
     properties ('fountain-goto-page').


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Syntax Highlighting,  Next: Element Aligning,  Prev: Navigation,  Up: Top

Syntax Highlighting
*******************

In Fountain Mode, each Fountain element can have Font Lock syntax
highlighting toggled individually -- or none at all.  *Note (emacs) Font
Lock::.

   In addition to faces for specific elements, Fountain Mode uses an
Emacs feature called face remapping, which means the 'default' face is
displayed using the 'fountain' face.  This allows you to customize the
'fountain' face just for Fountain Mode buffers.  *Note (emacs) Face
Customization::.

 -- User Option: fountain-highlight-elements
     This option is a list of Fountain elements to be highlighted.

 -- Command: fountain-toggle-hide-emphasis-markup
     Bound to 'C-c C-x *' this command will toggle the display of text
     emphasis markup.  *Note Text Emphasis::.

 -- Command: fountain-toggle-hide-element-markup
     Bound to 'C-c C-x !', this command, like above, will toggle the
     display of element markup.  This means the leadings characters in
     section headings and forced elements.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Element Aligning,  Next: Text Emphasis,  Prev: Syntax Highlighting,  Up: Top

Element Aligning
****************

In addition to syntax highlighting, Fountain Mode has the ability to
automatically align, or indent, script elements, so your script looks
more like real script.  This is display only and does not change the
file contents, and can be turned off if you don't like it.

 -- User Option: fountain-align-elements
     Whether to automatically align elements.

   Different script formats have different alignment, so each element
can be aligned on a per-format basis -- see the Customize group
'fountain-align'.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Text Emphasis,  Next: Do What I Mean,  Prev: Element Aligning,  Up: Top

Text Emphasis
*************

Text can be underlined, italic, bold, or a combination thereof.
Demarcate emphasized text with:

   * '_underscores_' for underline,
   * '*single asterisks*' for italic,
   * and '**double asterisks**' for bold.

   For the writer pursists who want to work the way our ancestors did on
typewriters, stick to underlining.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Do What I Mean,  Next: Autocompletion,  Prev: Text Emphasis,  Up: Top

Do What I Mean
**************

Like many screenwriting programs, in Fountain Mode pressing 'TAB' will
do the most convenient thing based on context.

   The most common use is triggering autocompletion.  If the point is at
a blank line or the end of a non-blank line, pressing 'TAB' will call
'completion-at-point'.  *Note Autocompletion::.

   In Fountain Mode, 'TAB' is also used to control outline visibility.
So if point is at a scene or section heading, it will cycle visibility
of that scene of section between collapsed and expanded.  To allow for
more control over outline cycling, if 'TAB' is prefixed with 'ARG', call
'fountain-outline-cycle' and pass 'ARG'.  *Note Outlining::.

   'TAB' also helps working with parentheticals.  If the point is at a
blank line within dialogue, it will insert a parenthetical; if the point
is inside an empty parenthetical, it will delete it, or if inside a
non-empty parenthetical, move to a newline.

   If the point is at or inside a note, 'TAB' will cycle visibility of
that note between collapsed and expanded.

   This all might seem complicated, but the idea is by covering all the
cases you don't have to think about it.

 -- Command: fountain-dwim
     This is the command you'll use the most.  Bound to 'TAB', it will
     perform the most convenient action based on the current context.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Autocompletion,  Next: Scene Numbering,  Prev: Do What I Mean,  Up: Top

Autocompletion
**************

One of the nice things about using a dedicated screenwriting program is
that it helps you type less of the things you need to type a lot.
Fountain Mode provides autocompletion for scene headings and character
names.

 -- Command: fountain-completion-update
     This command, bound to 'C-c C-x a' will update the completion
     candidates for current buffer.

* Menu:

* Scene Heading Completion::	Complete times and places.
* Character Name Completion::	For every time someone speaks.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Scene Heading Completion,  Next: Character Name Completion,  Up: Autocompletion

Scene Heading Completion
========================

If the line has a partial scene heading, i.e.  it begins with a prefix
from 'fountain-scene-heading-prefix-list' like so:

     INT. |

   'TAB' will offer completions of previously used locations.

   If the cursor is at the time-of-day, like so:

     INT. SUBMARINE - |

   'TAB' will offer completions from
'fountain-scene-heading-suffix-list'.


File: fountain-mode.info,  Node: Character Name Completion,  Prev: Scene Heading Completion,  Up: Autocompletion

Character Name Completion
=========================

The most basic use of this is when pressing 'TAB' on an empty line.  If
there's an empty line above, this will offer to autocomplete a character
name.  Character names are suggested in the order:

  1. the second-to-last previously speaking character within the current
     scene, i.e.  a character's conversational partner;
  2. the last speaking character within the current scene, i.e.  a
     character continuing speaking;
  3. the remaining characters in the script in order of frequency
     (default if there are not yet speaking characters in the current
     scene).

   'TAB' will also offer character name completion if a line has a
partial character name.

   When the cursor is after a character name and opening parenthesis,
'TAB' will offer completions from 'fountain-character-extension-list'
plus 'fountain-continued-dialog-string'.

     MARY (|

   When the cursor is at an empty line within dialogue, 'TAB' will add
an empty parenthetical.

     MARY
     |
     I'm hungry.

   Likewise, if the cursor is within an empty parenthetical, 'TAB' will
remove the parenthetical.

     MARY
     (|)
     I'm hungry.

   When the cursor is at the end of a non-empty parenthetical, either
inside or outside the closing parenthesis, 'TAB' will move to the
beginning of the next line if the next line is non-empty, otherwise it
will insert a newline.

     MARY
     (angry|)
     I'm hungry.

   When the cursor is at the end of a non-empty line of dialogue, and
the value of 'fountain-dwim-insert-next-character' is non-nil, 'TAB'
will insert an empty line and the second-to-last previously speaking
character.

     MARY
     (angry)
     I'm hungry.|

   The cursor will be left at the end of the next character, allowing
successive presses of 'TAB' to cycling through additional character
completion candidates.

     MARY
     (angry)
     I'm hungry.

Scene Numbering
***************

Scene numbers are appended to scene headings between '# #' (hash).
Fountain Mode can automatically add scene numbers for you.

 -- Command: fountain-add-scene-numbers
     Bound to 'C-c C-x #', add scene numbers to scene headings in
     current buffer.  Remove scene numbers by prefixing with 'C-u'.

   Whether scene numbers are applied or not, you can still navigate by
scene number.  *Note Navigation::.

   Scene numbers can be displayed in the window margins.

 -- User Option: fountain-display-scene-numbers-in-margin
     Display scene numbers in left and right margins.

Pagination
**********

Fountain Mode features internal pagination.  This is achieved by
periodically calculating where page breaks occur in the whole buffer and
applying pagination properties to the text.  When the text is changed
enough to invalidate these properties they are recalculated.

 -- User Option: fountain-pagination-max-change
     Maximum change in page characters before invalidating pagination.
     Set this to a lower value to get more accurate pagination, high if
     you find the updates annoying.

 -- User Option: fountain-page-size
     An important factor in calculating pagination is the page size.
     This is the target page size.  Valid options are 'letter' or 'a4'.

 -- User Option: fountain-page-max-lines
     This option specifies how many lines fit on each of the page sizes.

 -- User Option: fountain-pagination-break-sentences
     Whether pagination will break pages within sentences, or only at
     sentence ends.

   You can optionally show the current page and total page count in the
mode line by enabling 'which-function-mode', *Note (emacs) Which
Function::.  This will display something like this:

     [Page 31 of 108]

 -- Command: fountain-count-pages
     Bound to 'C-c C-p', return both the current page and the total page
     count of the current buffer.

   You can also navigate by page number.  *Note Navigation::.

Exporting
*********

Fountain Mode can export to PostScript or PDF using the troff format as
an intermediary.  This requires only a 'troff' program on your system,
such as GNU roff (https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/).  One advantage
of this is that the internal pagination will match the output exactly.

   Alternatively you can export using an external command-line program,
which is covered further below.

 -- Command: fountain-export-troff
     This command, bound to 'C-c C-e t', will export using the internal
     exporter and typeset using a 'troff' program.

 -- Command: fountain-export-view
     This command, bound to 'C-c C-v', attempts to open the last
     exported file.  This works by finding the other most recently
     modified file in the current directory matching the current file
     base-name.

 -- User Option: fountain-export-format
     This is the target format for internal troff export.  Valid options
     are Postscript ('ps') or PDF ('pdf').

 -- User Option: fountain-export-troff-command
     The name of the 'troff' program on your system.

 -- User Option: fountain-export-troff-extra-options
     Extra option flags passed to the 'troff' program.  The default
     tells 'troff' the to use UTF-8.

 -- User Option: fountain-export-title-page
     Whether to include a title page in export.  This only affects the
     internal troff export.

 -- User Option: fountain-export-number-first-page
     Whether to include a page number on the first page in export.  This
     only affects the internal troff export.

 -- User Option: fountain-export-scene-heading-format
     A list specifying the export scene heading format.  Available
     options are zero or more of 'bold', 'double-space', and
     'underline'.  This option only affects the internal troff export.

Exporting Using an External Program
===================================

As an alternative to the internal export system you can use an external
command-line program.

   Here are some recommended export programs:

   * Afterwriting (https://github.com/ifrost/afterwriting-labs)
   * Wrap (https://github.com/Wraparound/wrap)
   * Screenplain (https://github.com/vilcans/screenplain)
   * Textplay (https://github.com/olivertaylor/Textplay) (1)

   By defining an "export profile" you can easily interface with an
external program from within Emacs.  A profile is essentially a shell
command, interpolated with a selection of values:

   * '%b' is the 'buffer-file-name'
   * '%B' is the 'buffer-file-name' sans extension
   * '%n' is the 'user-full-name'
   * '%t' is the title (*Note Metadata::.)
   * '%a' is the author (*Note Metadata::.)
   * '%F' is the current date in ISO format
   * '%x' is the current date in your locale's "preferred" format

   The default command profiles are only intended as examples.  You are
encouraged to edit/replace these to suit your own needs.

 -- Command: fountain-export-command
     This command, bound to 'C-c C-e e', will prompt for an export
     profile.  The first profile is considered default, so just hitting
     RET is a quick way to export in your usual way.

 -- User Option: fountain-export-command-profiles
     This option contains the list of shell command profiles for
     exporting.  The first profile is considered the default.
