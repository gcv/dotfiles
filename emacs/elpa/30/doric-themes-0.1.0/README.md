# Doric themes for GNU Emacs

These are my minimalist themes. They use few colours and will appear
mostly monochromatic in many contexts. Styles involve the careful use
of typography, such as italics and bold italics.

If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my `ef-themes`
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
"default theme" for a text editor, opt for my `modus-themes`.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `doric-themes`
+ Sample pictures: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/doric-themes-pictures>
+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes>
+ Backronym: Doric Only Really Intensifies Conservatively ... themes.

## Sample configuration

```elisp
;; I will update this once the actual package is available.  For now,
;; you have to clone the Git repository somewhere, then specify that
;; in the `:load-path' below.
(use-package doric-themes
  :ensure nil
  :demand t
  :load-path "~/Git/Projects/doric-themes/"
  :config
  ;; These are the default values.
  (setq doric-themes-to-toggle '(doric-light doric-dark))
  (setq doric-themes-to-rotate doric-themes-collection)

  (doric-themes-select 'doric-light)

  ;; ;; To load a random theme instead, use something like one of these:
  ;;
  ;; (doric-themes-load-random)
  ;; (doric-themes-load-random 'light)
  ;; (doric-themes-load-random 'dark)

  ;; ;; For optimal results, also define your preferred font family (or use my `fontaine' package):
  ;;
  ;; (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Aporetic Sans Mono" :height 160)
  ;; (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Aporetic Sans" :height 1.0)
  ;; (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Aporetic Sans Mono" :height 1.0)

  :bind
  (("<f5>" . doric-themes-toggle)
   ("C-<f5>" . doric-themes-select)
   ("M-<f5>" . doric-themes-rotate)))
```
