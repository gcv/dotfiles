1 Overview
**********

Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the following core design
principles:

Predictability
     File names must follow a consistent and descriptive naming
     convention (*note The file-naming scheme::).  The file name alone
     should offer a clear indication of what the contents are, without
     reference to any other metadatum.  This convention is not specific
     to note-taking, as it is pertinent to any form of file that is part
     of the user’s long-term storage (*note Renaming files::).

Composability
     Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other packages or
     built-in functionality instead of re-inventing functions such as
     for filtering or greping.  The author of Denote (Protesilaos, aka
     “Prot”) writes ordinary notes in plain text (‘.txt’), switching on
     demand to an Org file only when its expanded set of functionality
     is required for the task at hand (*note Points of entry::).

Portability
     Notes are plain text and should remain portable.  The way Denote
     writes file names, the front matter it includes in the note’s
     header, and the links it establishes must all be adequately usable
     with standard Unix tools.  No need for a database or some
     specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual is fully
     fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do the
     Denote-equivalent on the command-line.

Flexibility
     Do not assume the user’s preference for a note-taking methodology.
     Denote is conceptually similar to the Zettelkasten Method, which
     you can learn more about in this detailed introduction:
     <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>.  Notes are atomic (one
     file per note) and have a unique identifier.  However, Denote does
     not enforce a particular methodology for knowledge management, such
     as a restricted vocabulary or mutually exclusive sets of keywords.
     Denote also does not check if the user writes thematically atomic
     notes.  It is up to the user to apply the requisite rigor and/or
     creativity in pursuit of their preferred workflow (*note Writing
     metanotes::).

Hackability
     Denote’s code base consists of small and reusable functions.  They
     all have documentation strings.  The idea is to make it easier for
     users of varying levels of expertise to understand what is going on
     and make surgical interventions where necessary (e.g.  to tweak
     some formatting).  In this manual, we provide concrete examples on
     such user-level configurations (*note Keep a journal or diary::).

   Now the important part... “Denote” is the familiar word, though it
also is a play on the “note” concept.  Plus, we can come up with
acronyms, recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility like:

   • Don’t Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal
   • Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses

   But we’ll let you get back to work.  Don’t Eschew or Neglect your
Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

2 Points of entry
*****************

There are five ways to write a note with Denote: invoke the ‘denote’,
‘denote-type’, ‘denote-date’, ‘denote-subdirectory’, ‘denote-template’
commands, or leverage the ‘org-capture-templates’ by setting up a
template which calls the function ‘denote-org-capture’.  We explain all
of those in the subsequent sections.

2.1 Standard note creation
==========================

The ‘denote’ command will prompt for a title.  If a region is active,
the text of the region becomes the default at the minibuffer prompt
(meaning that typing ‘RET’ without any input will use the default
value).  Once the title is supplied, the ‘denote’ command will then ask
for keywords.  The resulting note will have a file name as already
explained: *note The file naming scheme: The file-naming scheme.

   The file type of the new note is determined by the user option
‘denote-file-type’ (*note Front matter::).

   The keywords’ prompt supports minibuffer completion.  Available
candidates are those defined in the user option ‘denote-known-keywords’.
More candidates can be inferred from the names of existing notes, by
setting ‘denote-infer-keywords’ to non-nil (which is the case by
default).

   Multiple keywords can be inserted by separating them with a comma (or
whatever the value of the ‘crm-separator’ is—which should be a comma).
When the user option ‘denote-sort-keywords’ is non-nil (the default),
keywords are sorted alphabetically (technically, the sorting is done
with ‘string-lessp’).

   The interactive behaviour of the ‘denote’ command is influenced by
the user option ‘denote-prompts’ (*note The denote-prompts option: The
denote-prompts option.).

   The ‘denote’ command can also be called from Lisp.  Read its doc
string for the technicalities.

   In the interest of discoverability, ‘denote’ is also available under
the alias ‘denote-create-note’.

2.1.1 The ‘denote-prompts’ option
---------------------------------

The user option ‘denote-prompts’ determines how the ‘denote’ command
will behave interactively (*note Standard note creation::).

   The value is a list of symbols, which includes any of the following:

   • ‘title’: Prompt for the title of the new note.

   • ‘keywords’: Prompts with completion for the keywords of the new
     note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user option
     ‘denote-known-keywords’.  If the user option
     ‘denote-infer-keywords’ is non-nil, keywords in existing note file
     names are included in the list of candidates.  The ‘keywords’
     prompt uses ‘completing-read-multiple’, meaning that it can accept
     multiple keywords separated by a comma (or whatever the value of
     ‘crm-sepator’ is).

   • ‘file-type’: Prompts with completion for the file type of the new
     note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user option
     ‘denote-file-type’.  Without this prompt, ‘denote’ uses the value
     of ‘denote-file-type’.

   • ‘subdirectory’: Prompts with completion for a subdirectory in which
     to create the note.  Available candidates are the value of the user
     option ‘denote-directory’ and all of its subdirectories.  Any
     subdirectory must already exist: Denote will not create it.

   • ‘date’: Prompts for the date of the new note.  It will expect an
     input like 2022-06-16 or a date plus time: 2022-06-16 14:30.
     Without the ‘date’ prompt, the ‘denote’ command uses the
     ‘current-time’.

     *note The denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option: The
     denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option.

   • ‘template’: Prompts for a KEY among the ‘denote-templates’.  The
     value of that KEY is used to populate the new note with content,
     which is added after the front matter (*note The denote-templates
     option: The denote-templates option.).

   The prompts occur in the given order.

   If the value of this user option is nil, no prompts are used.  The
resulting file name will consist of an identifier (i.e.  the date and
time) and a supported file type extension (per ‘denote-file-type’).

   Recall that Denote’s standard file-naming scheme is defined as
follows (*note The file-naming scheme::):

     DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT

   If either or both of the ‘title’ and ‘keywords’ prompts are not
included in the value of this variable, file names will be any of those
permutations:

     DATE.EXT
     DATE--TITLE.EXT
     DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT

   When in doubt, always include the ‘title’ and ‘keywords’ prompts.

   Finally, this user option only affects the interactive use of the
‘denote’ command (advanced users can call it from Lisp).  For ad-hoc
interactive actions that do not change the default behaviour of the
‘denote’ command, users can invoke these convenience commands:
‘denote-type’, ‘denote-subdirectory’, ‘denote-date’.  They are described
in the subsequent section (*note Convenience commands for note
creation::).


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: The denote-templates option,  Next: Convenience commands for note creation,  Prev: The denote-prompts option,  Up: Standard note creation

2.1.2 The ‘denote-templates’ option
-----------------------------------

The user option ‘denote-templates’ is an alist of content templates for
new notes.  A template is arbitrary text that Denote will add to a newly
created note right below the front matter.

   Templates are expressed as a ‘(KEY . STRING)’ association.

   • The ‘KEY’ is the name which identifies the template.  It is an
     arbitrary symbol, such as ‘report’, ‘memo’, ‘statement’.

   • The ‘STRING’ is ordinary text that Denote will insert as-is.  It
     can contain newline characters to add spacing.  Below we show some
     concrete examples.

   The user can choose a template either by invoking the command
‘denote-template’ or by changing the user option ‘denote-prompts’ to
always prompt for a template when calling the ‘denote’ command.

   *note The denote-prompts option: The denote-prompts option.

   *note Convenience commands for note creation::.

   Templates can be written directly as one large string.  For example
(the ‘\n’ character is read as a newline):

     (setq denote-templates
           '((report . "* Some heading\n\n* Another heading")
             (memo . "* Some heading

     * Another heading

     ")))

   Long strings may be easier to type but interpret indentation
literally.  Also, they do not scale well.  A better way is to use some
Elisp code to construct the string.  This would typically be the
‘concat’ function, which joins multiple strings into one.  The following
is the same as the previous example:

     (setq denote-templates
           `((report . "* Some heading\n\n* Another heading")
             (memo . ,(concat "* Some heading"
                              "\n\n"
                              "* Another heading"
                              "\n\n"))))

   Notice that to evaluate a function inside of an alist we use the
backtick to quote the alist (NOT the straight quote) and then prepend a
comma to the expression that should be evaluated.  The ‘concat’ form
here is not sensitive to indentation, so it is easier to adjust for
legibility.

   DEV NOTE: We do not provide more examples at this point, though feel
welcome to ask for help if the information provided herein is not
sufficient.  We shall expand the manual accordingly.

2.1.3 Convenience commands for note creation
--------------------------------------------

Sometimes the user needs to create a note that has different
requirements from those of ‘denote’ (*note Standard note creation::).
While this can be achieved globally by changing the ‘denote-prompts’
user option, there are cases where an ad-hoc method is the appropriate
one (*note The denote-prompts option: The denote-prompts option.).

   To this end, Denote provides the following convenience interactive
commands for note creation:

Create note by specifying file type
     The ‘denote-type’ command creates a note while prompting for a file
     type.

     This is the equivalent to calling ‘denote’ when ‘denote-prompts’ is
     set to ‘'(file-type title keywords)’.  In practical terms, this
     lets you produce, say, a note in Markdown even though you normally
     write in Org (*note Standard note creation::).

     The ‘denote-create-note-using-type’ is an alias of ‘denote-type’.

Create note using a date
     Normally, Denote reads the current date and time to construct the
     unique identifier of a newly created note (*note Standard note
     creation::).  Sometimes, however, the user needs to set an explicit
     date+time value.

     This is where the ‘denote-date’ command comes in.  It creates a
     note while prompting for a date.  The date can be in YEAR-MONTH-DAY
     notation like ‘2022-06-30’ or that plus the time: ‘2022-06-16
     14:30’.

     *note The denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option: The
     denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option.

     This is the equivalent to calling ‘denote’ when ‘denote-prompts’ is
     set to ‘'(date title keywords)’.

     The ‘denote-create-note-using-date’ is an alias of ‘denote-date’.

Create note in a specific directory
     The ‘denote-subdirectory’ command creates a note while prompting
     for a subdirectory.  Available candidates include the value of the
     variable ‘denote-directory’ and any subdirectory thereof (Denote
     does not create subdirectories).

     This is equivalent to calling ‘denote’ when ‘denote-prompts’ is set
     to ‘'(subdirectory title keywords)’.

     The ‘denote-create-note-in-subdirectory’ is a more descriptive
     alias of ‘denote-subdirectory’.

Create note and add a template
     The ‘denote-template’ command creates a new note and inserts the
     specified template below the front matter (*note The
     denote-templates option: The denote-templates option.).  Available
     candidates for templates are specified in the user option
     ‘denote-templates’.

     This is equivalent to calling ‘denote’ when ‘denote-prompts’ is set
     to ‘'(template title keywords)’.

     The ‘denote-create-note-with-template’ is an alias of the command
     ‘denote-template’, meant to help with discoverability.

  1. Write your own convenience commands

     The convenience commands we provide only cover some basic use-cases
     (*note Convenience commands for note creation::).  The user may
     require combinations that are not covered, such as to prompt for a
     template and for a subdirectory, instead of only one of the two.
     To this end, we show how to follow the code we use in Denote to
     write your own variants of those commands.

     First let’s take a look at the definition of one of those commands.
     They all look the same, but we use ‘denote-subdirectory’ for this
     example:

          (defun denote-subdirectory ()
            "Create note while prompting for a subdirectory.

          Available candidates include the value of the variable
          `denote-directory' and any subdirectory thereof.

          This is equivalent to calling `denote' when `denote-prompts' is
          set to '(subdirectory title keywords)."
            (declare (interactive-only t))
            (interactive)
            (let ((denote-prompts '(subdirectory title keywords)))
              (call-interactively #'denote)))

     The hyphenated word after ‘defun’ is the name of the function.  It
     has to be unique.  Then we have the documentation string (or “doc
     string”) which is for the user’s convenience.

     This function is ‘interactive’, meaning that it can be called via
     ‘M-x’ or be assigned to a key binding.  Then we have the local
     binding of the ‘denote-prompts’ to the desired combination (“local”
     means specific to this function without affecting other contexts).
     Lastly, it calls the standard ‘denote’ command interactively, so it
     uses all the prompts in their specified order.

     Now let’s say we want to have a command that (i) asks for a
     template and (ii) for a subdirectory (*note The denote-templates
     option: The denote-templates option.).  All we need to do is tweak
     the ‘let’ bound value of ‘denote-prompts’ and give our command a
     unique name:

          ;; Like `denote-subdirectory' but also ask for a template
          (defun denote-subdirectory-with-template ()
            "Create note while also prompting for a template and subdirectory.

          This is equivalent to calling `denote' when `denote-prompts' is
          set to '(template subdirectory title keywords)."
            (declare (interactive-only t))
            (interactive)
            (let ((denote-prompts '(template subdirectory title keywords)))
              (call-interactively #'denote)))

     The tweaks to ‘denote-prompts’ determine how the command will
     behave (*note The denote-prompts option: The denote-prompts
     option.).  Use this paradigm to write your own variants which you
     can then assign to keys or invoke with ‘M-x’.

2.1.4 The ‘denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date’ option
-------------------------------------------------------

By default, Denote uses its own simple prompt for date or date+time
input (*note The denote-prompts option: The denote-prompts option.).
This is done when the ‘denote-prompts’ option includes a ‘date’ symbol
and/or when the user invokes the ‘denote-date’ command.

   Users who want to benefit from the more advanced date selection
method that is common in interactions with Org mode, can set the user
option ‘denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date’ to a non-nil value.

2.1.5 Add or remove keywords interactively
------------------------------------------

The commands ‘denote-keywords-add’ and ‘denote-keywords-remove’
streamline the process of interactively updating a file’s keywords in
the front matter and renaming it accordingly.

   The ‘denote-keywords-add’ asks for keywords using the familiar
minibuffer prompt (*note Standard note creation::).  It then renames the
file (*note Rename a single file based on its front matter::).

   Similarly, the ‘denote-keywords-remove’ removes one or more keywords
from the list of existing keywords and then renames the file
accordingly.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Create note using Org capture,  Next: Maintain separate directory silos for notes,  Prev: Standard note creation,  Up: Points of entry

2.2 Create note using Org capture
=================================

For integration with ‘org-capture’, the user must first add the relevant
template.  Such as:

     (with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
       (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
                    '("n" "New note (with Denote)" plain
                      (file denote-last-path)
                      #'denote-org-capture
                      :no-save t
                      :immediate-finish nil
                      :kill-buffer t
                      :jump-to-captured t)))

   [ In the future, we might develop Denote in ways which do not require
such manual intervention.  More user feedback is required to identify
the relevant workflows.  ]

   Once the template is added, it is accessed from the specified key.
If, for instance, ‘org-capture’ is bound to ‘C-c c’, then the note
creation is initiated with ‘C-c c n’, per the above snippet.  After
that, the process is the same as with invoking ‘denote’ directly,
namely: a prompt for a title followed by a prompt for keywords (*note
Standard note creation::).

   Users may prefer to leverage ‘org-capture’ in order to extend file
creation with the specifiers described in the ‘org-capture-templates’
documentation (such as to capture the active region and/or create a
hyperlink pointing to the given context).

   IMPORTANT.  Due to the particular file-naming scheme of Denote, which
is derived dynamically, such specifiers or other arbitrary text cannot
be written directly in the template.  Instead, they have to be assigned
to the user option ‘denote-org-capture-specifiers’, which is interpreted
by the function ‘denote-org-capture’.  Example with our default value:

     (setq denote-org-capture-specifiers "%l\n%i\n%?")

   Note that ‘denote-org-capture’ ignores the ‘denote-file-type’: it
always sets the Org file extension for the created note to ensure that
the capture process works as intended, especially for the desired output
of the ‘denote-org-capture-specifiers’.

2.3 Maintain separate directory silos for notes
===============================================

The user option ‘denote-directory’ accepts a value that represents the
path to a directory, such as ‘~/Documents/notes’.  Normally, the user
will have one place where they store all their notes, in which case this
arrangement shall suffice.

   There is, however, the possibility to maintain separate directories
of notes.  By “separate”, we mean that they do not communicate with each
other: no linking between them, no common keywords, nothing.  Think of
the scenario where one set of notes is for private use and another is
for an employer.  We call these separate directories “silos”.

   To create silos, the user must specify a local variable at the root
of the desired directory.  This is done by creating a ‘.dir-locals.el’
file, with the following contents:

     ;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
     ;;;
     ;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

     ((nil . ((denote-directory . default-directory))))

   When inside the directory that contains this ‘.dir-locals.el’ file,
all Denote commands/functions for note creation, linking, the inference
of available keywords, et cetera will use the silo as their point of
reference.  They will not read the global value of ‘denote-directory’.
The global value of ‘denote-directory’ is read everywhere else except
the silos.

   In concrete terms, this is a representation of the directory
structures (notice the ‘.dir-locals.el’ file is needed only for the
silos):

     ;; This is the global value of 'denote-directory' (no need for a .dir-locals.el)
     ~/Documents/notes
     |-- 20210303T120534--this-is-a-test__journal_philosophy.txt
     |-- 20220303T120534--another-sample__journal_testing.md
     `-- 20220620T181255--the-third-test__keyword.org

     ;; A silo with notes for the employer
     ~/different/path/to/notes-for-employer
     |-- .dir-locals.el
     |-- 20210303T120534--this-is-a-test__conference.txt
     |-- 20220303T120534--another-sample__meeting.md
     `-- 20220620T181255--the-third-test__keyword.org

     ;; Another silo with notes for my volunteering
     ~/different/path/to/notes-for-volunteering
     |-- .dir-locals.el
     |-- 20210303T120534--this-is-a-test__activism.txt
     |-- 20220303T120534--another-sample__teambuilding.md
     `-- 20220620T181255--the-third-test__keyword.org

   It is possible to configure other user options of Denote to have a
silo-specific value.  For example, this one changes the
‘denote-known-keywords’ only for this particular silo:

     ;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
     ;;;
     ;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

     ((nil . ((denote-directory . default-directory)
              (denote-known-keywords . ("food" "drink")))))

   This one is like the above, but also disables
‘denote-infer-keywords’:

     ;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
     ;;;
     ;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

     ((nil . ((denote-directory . default-directory)
              (denote-known-keywords . ("food" "drink"))
              (denote-infer-keywords . nil))))

   To expand the list of local variables to, say, cover specific major
modes, we can do something like this:

     ;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
     ;;;
     ;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

     ((nil . ((denote-directory . default-directory)
              (denote-known-keywords . ("food" "drink"))
              (denote-infer-keywords . nil)))
      (org-mode . ((org-hide-emphasis-markers . t)
                   (org-hide-macro-markers . t)
                   (org-hide-leading-stars . t))))

   As not all user options have a “safe” local value, Emacs will ask the
user to confirm their choice and to store it in the Custom code snippet
that is normally appended to init file (or added to the file specified
by the user option ‘custom-file’).

   Finally, it is possible to have a ‘.dir-locals.el’ for subdirectories
of any ‘denote-directory’.  Perhaps to specify a different set of known
keywords, while not making the subdirectory a silo in its own right.  We
shall not expand on such an example, as we trust the user to experiment
with the best setup for their workflow.

   Feel welcome to ask for help if the information provided herein is
not sufficient.  The manual shall be expanded accordingly.

2.4 Exclude certain directories from all operations
===================================================

The user option ‘denote-excluded-directories-regexp’ instructs all
Denote functions that read or check file/directory names to omit
directories that match the given regular expression.  The regexp needs
to match only the name of the directory, not its full path.

   Affected operations include file prompts and functions that return
the available files in the value of the user option ‘denote-directory’
(*note Maintain separate directory silos for notes::).

   File prompts are used by several commands, such as ‘denote-link’ and
‘denote-subdirectory’.

   Functions that check for files include ‘denote-directory-files’ and
‘denote-directory-subdirectories’.

   The match is performed with ‘string-match-p’.

3 Renaming files
****************

Denote provides commands to rename files and update their front matter
where relevant.  For Denote to work, only the file name needs to be in
order, by following our naming conventions (*note The file-naming
scheme::).  The linking mechanism, in particular, needs just the
identifier in the file name (*note Linking notes::).

   We write front matter in notes for the user’s convenience and for
other tools to make use of that information (e.g.  Org’s export
mechanism).  The renaming mechanism takes care to keep this data in sync
with the file name, when the user performs a change.

   Renaming is useful for managing existing files created with Denote,
but also for converting older text files to Denote notes.

   Lastly, Denote’s file-naming scheme is not specific to notes or text
files: it is useful for all sorts of items, such as multimedia and PDFs
that form part of the user’s longer-term storage.  While Denote does not
manage such files (e.g.  doesn’t create links to them), it already has
all the mechanisms to facilitate the task of renaming them.

File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Rename a single file,  Next: Rename multiple files at once,  Up: Renaming files

3.1 Rename a single file
========================

The ‘denote-rename-file’ command renames a file and updates existing
front matter if appropriate.

   If in Dired, the ‘FILE’ to be renamed is the one at point, else the
command prompts with minibuffer completion for a target file.

   If ‘FILE’ has a Denote-compliant identifier, retain it while updating
the ‘TITLE’ and ‘KEYWORDS’ fields of the file name.  Else create an
identifier based on the following conditions:

   • If ‘FILE’ does not have an identifier and optional ‘DATE’ is
     non-nil (such as with a prefix argument), invoke the function
     ‘denote-prompt-for-date-return-id’.  It prompts for a date and uses
     it to derive the identifier.

   • If ‘FILE’ does not have an identifier and optional ‘DATE’ is nil
     (this is the case without a prefix argument), use the file
     attributes to determine the last modified date and format it as an
     identifier.

   • As a fallback, derive an identifier from the current time.

   The default ‘TITLE’ is retrieved from a line starting with a title
field in the file’s contents, depending on the given file type (*note
Front matter::).  Else, the file name is used as a default value at the
minibuffer prompt.

   As a final step after the ‘FILE’, ‘TITLE’, and ‘KEYWORDS’ prompts,
ask for confirmation, showing the difference between old and new file
names.  For example:

     Rename sample.txt to 20220612T052900--my-sample-title__testing.txt? (y or n)

   The file type extension (e.g.  ‘.txt’) is read from the underlying
file and is preserved through the renaming process.  Files that have no
extension are simply left without one.

   Renaming only occurs relative to the current directory.  Files are
not moved between directories.

   If the ‘FILE’ has Denote-style front matter for the ‘TITLE’ and
‘KEYWORDS’, this command asks to rewrite their values in order to
reflect the new input (this step always requires confirmation and the
underlying buffer is not saved, so consider invoking
‘diff-buffer-with-file’ to double-check the effect).  The rewrite of the
‘FILE’ and ‘KEYWORDS’ in the front matter should not affect the rest of
the block.

   If the file doesn’t have front matter but is among the supported file
types (per ‘denote-file-type’), the ‘denote-rename-file’ command adds
front matter at the top of it and leaves the buffer unsaved for further
inspection.

   This command is intended to (i) rename existing Denote notes while
updating their title and keywords in the front matter, (ii) convert
existing supported file types to Denote notes, and (ii) rename non-note
files (e.g.  PDF) that can benefit from Denote’s file-naming scheme.
The latter is a convenience we provide, since we already have all the
requisite mechanisms in place (though Denote does not—and will
not—manage such files).


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Rename multiple files at once,  Next: Rename a single file based on its front matter,  Prev: Rename a single file,  Up: Renaming files

3.2 Rename multiple files at once
=================================

The ‘denote-dired-rename-marked-files’ command renames marked files in
Dired to conform with our file-naming scheme.  The operation does the
following:

   • the file’s existing file name is retained and becomes the ‘TITLE’
     field, per Denote’s file-naming scheme;

   • the ‘TITLE’ is sluggified and downcased, per our conventions;

   • an identifier is prepended to the ‘TITLE’;

   • the file’s extension is retained;

   • a prompt is asked once for the ‘KEYWORDS’ field and the input is
     applied to all file names;

   • if the file is recognized as a Denote note, this command adds or
     rewrites front matter to include the new keywords.  A confirmation
     to carry out this step is performed once at the outset.  Note that
     the affected buffers are not saved.  The user can thus check them
     to confirm that the new front matter does not cause any problems
     (e.g.  with the command ‘diff-buffer-with-file’).  Multiple buffers
     can be saved with ‘save-some-buffers’ (read its doc string).  The
     addition of front matter takes place only if the given file has the
     appropriate file type extension (per the user option
     ‘denote-file-type’).

3.3 Rename a single file based on its front matter
==================================================

In the previous section, we covered the more general mechanism of the
command ‘denote-rename-file’ (*note Rename a single file::).  There is
also a way to have the same outcome by making Denote read the data in
the current file’s front matter and use it to construct/update the file
name.  The command for this is ‘denote-rename-file-using-front-matter’.
It is only relevant for files that (i) are among the supported file
types, per ‘denote-file-type’, and (ii) have the requisite front matter
in place.

   Suppose you have an ‘.org’ file with this front matter (*note Front
matter::):

     #+title:      My sample note file
     #+date:       [2022-08-05 Fri 13:10]
     #+filetags:   :testing:
     #+identifier: 20220805T131044

   Its file name reflects this information:

     20220805T131044--my-sample-note-file__testing.org

   You want to change its title and keywords manually, so you modify it
thus:

     #+title:      My modified sample note file
     #+date:       [2022-08-05 Fri 13:10]
     #+filetags:   :testing:denote:emacs:
     #+identifier: 20220805T131044

   The file name still shows the old title and keywords.  So after
saving the buffer, you invoke ‘denote-rename-file-using-front-matter’
and it updates the file name to:

     20220805T131044--my-modified-sample-note-file__testing_denote_emacs.org

   The renaming is subject to a “yes or no” prompt that shows the old
and new names, just so the user is certain about the change.

   If called interactively with a prefix argument ‘C-u’ or from Lisp
with a non-nil ‘AUTO-CONFIRM’ argument, this “yes or no” prompt is
skipped.

   The identifier of the file, if any, is never modified even if it is
edited in the front matter: Denote considers the file name to be the
source of truth in this case, to avoid potential breakage with typos and
the like.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Rename multiple files based on their front matter,  Prev: Rename a single file based on its front matter,  Up: Renaming files

3.4 Rename multiple files based on their front matter
=====================================================

As already noted, Denote can rename a file based on the data in its
front matter (*note Rename a single file based on its front matter::).
The command ‘denote-dired-rename-marked-files-using-front-matter’
extends this principle to a batch operation which applies to all marked
files in Dired.

   Marked files must count as notes for the purposes of Denote, which
means that they at least have an identifier in their file name and use a
supported file type, per ‘denote-file-type’.  Files that do not meet
this criterion are ignored.

   The operation does the following:

   • the title in the front matter becomes the ‘TITLE’ component of the
     file name (*note The file-naming scheme::);

   • the keywords in the front matter are used for the ‘KEYWORDS’
     component of the file name and are processed accordingly, if
     needed;

   • the identifier remains unchanged in the file name even if it is
     modified in the front matter (this is done to avoid breakage caused
     by typos and the like).

   NOTE that files must be saved, because Denote reads from the
underlying file, not a modified buffer (this is done to avoid potential
mistakes).  The return value of a modified buffer is the one prior to
the modification, i.e.  the one already written on disk.

   This command is useful for synchronizing multiple file names with
their respective front matter.

4 The file-naming scheme
************************

Notes are stored the ‘denote-directory’.  The default path is
‘~/Documents/notes’.  The ‘denote-directory’ can be a flat listing,
meaning that it has no subdirectories, or it can be a directory tree.
Either way, Denote takes care to only consider “notes” as valid
candidates in the relevant operations and will omit other files or
directories.

   Every note produced by Denote follows this pattern (*note Points of
entry::):

     DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION

   The ‘DATE’ field represents the date in year-month-day format
followed by the capital letter ‘T’ (for “time”) and the current time in
hour-minute-second notation.  The presentation is compact:
‘20220531T091625’.  The ‘DATE’ serves as the unique identifier of each
note.

   The ‘TITLE’ field is the title of the note, as provided by the user.
It automatically gets downcased and hyphenated.  An entry about
“Economics in the Euro Area” produces an ‘economics-in-the-euro-area’
string for the ‘TITLE’ of the file name.

   The ‘KEYWORDS’ field consists of one or more entries demarcated by an
underscore (the separator is inserted automatically).  Each keyword is a
string provided by the user at the relevant prompt which broadly
describes the contents of the entry.  Keywords that need to be more than
one-word-long must be written with hyphens: any other character, such as
spaces or the plus sign is automatically converted into a hyphen.  So
when ‘emacs_library’ appears in a file name, it is interpreted as two
distinct keywords, whereas ‘emacs-library’ is one keyword.  This is
reflected in how the keywords are recorded in the note (*note Front
matter::).  While Denote supports multi-word keywords by default, the
user option ‘denote-allow-multi-word-keywords’ can be set to nil to
forcibly join all words into one, meaning that an input of ‘word1 word2’
will be written as ‘word1word2’.

   The ‘EXTENSION’ is the file type.  By default, it is ‘.org’
(‘org-mode’) though the user option ‘denote-file-type’ provides support
for Markdown with YAML or TOML variants (‘.md’ which runs
‘markdown-mode’) and plain text (‘.txt’ via ‘text-mode’).  Consult its
doc string for the minutiae.  While files end in the ‘.org’ extension by
default, the Denote code base does not actually depend on org.el and/or
its accoutrements.

   Examples:

     20220610T043241--initial-thoughts-on-the-zettelkasten-method__notetaking.org
     20220610T062201--define-custom-org-hyperlink-type__denote_emacs_package.md
     20220610T162327--on-hierarchy-and-taxis__notetaking_philosophy.txt

   The different field separators, namely ‘--’ and ‘__’ introduce an
efficient way to anchor searches (such as with Emacs commands like
‘isearch’ or from the command-line with ‘find’ and related).  A query
for ‘_word’ always matches a keyword, while a regexp in the form of,
say, ‘"\\([0-9T]+?\\)--\\(.*?\\)_"’ captures the date in group ‘\1’ and
the title in ‘\2’ (test any regular expression in the current buffer by
invoking ‘M-x re-builder’).

   *note Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or
filtering::.

   While Denote is an Emacs package, notes should work long-term and not
depend on the functionality of a specific program.  The file-naming
scheme we apply guarantees that a listing is readable in a variety of
contexts.

4.1 Sluggified title and keywords
=================================

Denote has to be highly opinionated about which characters can be used
in file names and the file’s front matter in order to enforce its
file-naming scheme.  The private variable ‘denote--punctuation-regexp’
holds the relevant value.  In simple terms:

   • What we count as “illegal characters” are converted into hyphens.

   • Input for a file title is hyphenated and downcased.  The original
     value is preserved in the note’s contents (*note Front matter::).

   • Keywords should not have spaces or other delimiters.  If they do,
     they are converted into hyphens.  Keywords are always downcased.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering,  Prev: Sluggified title and keywords,  Up: The file-naming scheme

4.2 Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering
=================================================================

File names have three fields and two sets of field delimiters between
them:

     DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION

   The first field delimiter is the double hyphen, while the second is
the double underscore.  These practically serve as anchors for easier
searching.  Consider this example:

     20220621T062327--introduction-to-denote__denote_emacs.txt

   You will notice that there are two matches for the word ‘denote’: one
in the title field and another in the keywords’ field.  Because of the
distinct field delimiters, if we search for ‘-denote’ we only match the
first instance while ‘_denote’ targets the second one.  When sorting
through your notes, this kind of specificity is invaluable—and you get
it for free from the file names alone!

   Users can get a lot of value out of this simple arrangement, even if
they have no knowledge of regular expressions.  One thing to consider,
for maximum effect, is to avoid using multi-word keywords as those get
hyphenated like the title and will thus interfere with the above: either
set the user option ‘denote-allow-multi-word-keywords’ to nil or simply
insert single words at the relevant prompts.

5 Front matter
**************

Notes have their own “front matter”.  This is a block of data at the top
of the file, with no empty lines between the entries, which is
automatically generated at the creation of a new note.  The front matter
includes the title and keywords (aka “tags” or “filetags”, depending on
the file type) which the user specified at the relevant prompt, as well
as the date and unique identifier, which are derived automatically.

   This is how it looks for Org mode (when ‘denote-file-type’ is nil or
the ‘org’ symbol):

     #+title:      This is a sample note
     #+date:       [2022-06-30 Thu 16:09]
     #+filetags:   :denote:testing:
     #+identifier: 20220630T160934

   For Markdown with YAML (‘denote-file-type’ has the ‘markdown-yaml’
value), the front matter looks like this:

     ---
     title:      "This is a sample note"
     date:       2022-06-30T16:09:58+03:00
     tags:       ["denote", "testing"]
     identifier: "20220630T160958"
     ---

   For Markdown with TOML (‘denote-file-type’ has the ‘markdown-toml’
value), it is:

     +++
     title      = "This is a sample note"
     date       = 2022-06-30T16:10:13+03:00
     tags       = ["denote", "testing"]
     identifier = "20220630T161013"
     +++

   And for plain text (‘denote-file-type’ has the ‘text’ value), we have
the following:

     title:      This is a sample note
     date:       2022-06-30
     tags:       denote  testing
     identifier: 20220630T161028
     ---------------------------

   The format of the date in the front matter is controlled by the user
option ‘denote-date-format’.  When nil, Denote uses a file-type-specific
format:

   • For Org, an inactive timestamp is used, such as ‘[2022-06-30 Wed
     15:31]’.

   • For Markdown, the RFC3339 standard is applied:
     ‘2022-06-30T15:48:00+03:00’.

   • For plain text, the format is that of ISO 8601: ‘2022-06-30’.

   If the value is a string, ignore the above and use it instead.  The
string must include format specifiers for the date.  These are described
in the doc string of ‘format-time-string’..

5.1 Change the front matter format
==================================

Per Denote’s design principles, the code is hackable.  All front matter
is stored in variables that are intended for public use.  We do not
declare those as “user options” because (i) they expect the user to have
some degree of knowledge in Emacs Lisp and (ii) implement custom code.

   [ NOTE for tinkerers: code intended for internal use includes double
hyphens in its symbol.  “Internal use” means that it can be changed
without warning and with no further reference in the change log.  Do not
use any of it without understanding the consequences.  ]

   The variables which hold the front matter format are:

   • ‘denote-org-front-matter’

   • ‘denote-text-front-matter’

   • ‘denote-toml-front-matter’

   • ‘denote-yaml-front-matter’

   These variables have a string value with specifiers that are used by
the ‘format’ function.  The formatting operation passes four arguments
which include the values of the given entries.  If you are an advanced
user who wants to edit this variable to affect how front matter is
produced, consider using something like ‘%2$s’ to control where the Nth
argument is placed.

   When editing the value, make sure to:

  1. Not use empty lines inside the front matter block.

  2. Insert at least one empty line after the front matter block and do
     not use any empty line before it.

   These help with consistency and might prove useful if we ever need to
operate on the front matter as a whole.

   With those granted, below are some examples.  The approach is the
same for all variables.

     ;; Like the default, but upcase the entries
     (setq denote-org-front-matter
       "#+TITLE:      %s
     #+DATE:       %s
     #+FILETAGS:   %s

   Note that ‘setq’ has a global effect: it affects the creation of all
new notes.  Depending on the workflow, it may be preferrable to have a
custom command which ‘let’ binds the different format.  We shall not
provide examples at this point as this is a more advanced feature and we
are not yet sure what the user’s needs are.  Please provide feedback and
we shall act accordingly.

5.2 Regenerate front matter
===========================

Sometimes the user needs to produce new front matter for an existing
note.  Perhaps because they accidentally deleted a line and could not
undo the operation.  The command ‘denote-add-front-matter’ can be used
for this very purpose.

   In interactive use, ‘denote-add-front-matter’ must be invoked from a
buffer that visits a Denote note.  It prompts for a title and then for
keywords.  These are the standard prompts we already use for note
creation, so the keywords’ prompt allows minibuffer completion and the
input of multiple entries, each separated by a comma (*note Points of
entry::).

   The newly created front matter is added to the top of the file.

   This command does not rename the file (e.g.  to update the keywords).
To rename a file by reading its front matter as input, the user can rely
on ‘denote-rename-file-using-front-matter’ (*note Renaming files::).

   Note that ‘denote-add-front-matter’ is useful only for existing
Denote notes.  If the user needs to convert a generic text file to a
Denote note, they can use one of the command which first rename the file
to make it comply with our file-naming scheme and then add the relevant
front matter.

6 Linking notes
***************

Denote offers several commands for linking between notes.

   All links target files which are Denote notes.  This means that they
have our file-naming scheme, are writable/regular (not directory, named
pipe, etc.), and use the appropriate file type extension (per
‘denote-file-type’).  Furthermore, the files need to be inside the
‘denote-directory’ or one of its subdirectories.  No other file is
recognised.

   The following sections delve into the details.

File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Adding a single link,  Next: Insert links matching a regexp,  Up: Linking notes

6.1 Adding a single link
========================

The ‘denote-link’ command inserts a link at point to an entry specified
at the minibuffer prompt.  Links are formatted depending on the file
type of current note.  In Org and plain text buffers, links are
formatted thus: ‘[[denote:IDENTIFIER][TITLE]]’.  While in Markdown they
are expressed as ‘[TITLE](denote:IDENTIFIER)’.

   When ‘denote-link’ is called with a prefix argument (‘C-u’ by
default), it formats links like ‘[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]’.  The user might
prefer its simplicity.

   The description of the link is taken from the target file’s front
matter or, if that is not available, from the file name.  If the region
is active, its text is used as the link’s description instead.  If the
active region has no text, the inserted link used just the identifier,
as with the ‘C-u’ prefix mentioned above.

   Inserted links are automatically buttonized and remain active for as
long as the buffer is available.  In Org this is handled by the major
mode: the ‘denote:’ hyperlink type works exactly like the standard
‘file:’.  In Markdown and plain text, Denote performs the buttonization
of those links.  To buttonize links in existing files while visiting
them, the user must add this snippet to their setup (it already excludes
Org):

     (add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)

   The ‘denote-link-buttonize-buffer’ is also an interactive function in
case the user needs it.

   Links are created only for files which qualify as a “note” for our
purposes (*note Linking notes::).

   Links are styled with the ‘denote-faces-link’ face, which looks
exactly like an ordinary link by default.  This is just a convenience
for the user/theme in case they want ‘denote:’ links to remain distinct
from other links.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Insert links matching a regexp,  Next: Insert links but only those missing from current buffer,  Prev: Adding a single link,  Up: Linking notes

6.2 Insert links matching a regexp
==================================

The command ‘denote-link-add-links’ adds links at point matching a
regular expression or plain string.  The links are inserted as a
typographic list, such as:

     - link1
     - link2
     - link3

   Each link is formatted according to the file type of the current
note, as explained further above about the ‘denote-link’ command.  The
current note is excluded from the matching entries (adding a link to
itself is pointless).

   When called with a prefix argument (‘C-u’) ‘denote-link-add-links’
will format all links as ‘[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]’, hence a typographic
list:

     - [[denote:IDENTIFIER-1]]
     - [[denote:IDENTIFIER-2]]
     - [[denote:IDENTIFIER-3]]

   Same examples of a regular expression that can be used with this
command:

   • ‘journal’ match all files which include ‘journal’ anywhere in their
     name.

   • ‘_journal’ match all files which include ‘journal’ as a keyword.

   • ‘^2022.*_journal’ match all file names starting with ‘2022’ and
     including the keyword ‘journal’.

   • ‘\.txt’ match all files including ‘.txt’.  In practical terms, this
     only applies to the file extension, as Denote automatically removes
     dots (and other characters) from the base file name.

   If files are created with ‘denote-sort-keywords’ as non-nil (the
default), then it is easy to write a regexp that includes multiple
keywords in alphabetic order:

   • ‘_denote.*_package’ match all files that include both the ‘denote’
     and ‘package’ keywords, in this order.

   • ‘\(.*denote.*package.*\)\|\(.*package.*denote.*\)’ is the same as
     above, but out-of-order.

   Remember that regexp constructs only need to be escaped once (like
‘\|’) when done interactively but twice when called from Lisp.  What we
show above is for interactive usage.

   Links are created only for files which qualify as a “note” for our
purposes (*note Linking notes::).

6.3 Insert links, but only those missing from current buffer
============================================================

As a variation on the ‘denote-link-add-links’ command, one may wish to
only include ’missing links’, i.e.  links that are not yet present in
the current file.

   This can be achieved with ‘denote-link-add-missing-links’.  The
command is similar to ‘denote-link-add-links’, but will only include
links to notes that are not yet linked to (*note Insert links matching a
regexp::).


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Insert links from marked files in Dired,  Next: Link to an existing note or create a new one,  Prev: Insert links but only those missing from current buffer,  Up: Linking notes

6.4 Insert links from marked files in Dired
===========================================

The command ‘denote-link-dired-marked-notes’ is similar to
‘denote-link-add-links’ in that it inserts in the buffer a typographic
list of links to Denote notes (*note Insert links matching a regexp::).
Though instead of reading a regular expression, it lets the user mark
files in Dired and link to them.  This should be easier for users of all
skill levels, instead of having to write a potentially complex regular
expression.

   If there are multiple buffers that visit a Denote note, this command
will ask to select one among them, using minibuffer completion.  If
there is only one buffer, it will operate in it outright.  If there are
no buffers, it will produce an error.

   With optional ‘ID-ONLY’ as a prefix argument (‘C-u’ by default), the
command inserts links with just the identifier, which is the same
principle as with ‘denote-link’ and others (*note Adding a single
link::).

   The command ‘denote-link-dired-marked-notes’ is meant to be used from
a Dired buffer.

   As always, links are created only for files which qualify as a “note”
for our purposes (*note Linking notes::).


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Link to an existing note or create a new one,  Next: The backlinks' buffer,  Prev: Insert links from marked files in Dired,  Up: Linking notes

6.5 Link to an existing note or create a new one
================================================

In one’s note-taking workflow, there may come a point where they are
expounding on a certain topic but have an idea about another subject
they would like to link to (*note Linking notes::).  The user can always
rely on the other linking facilities we have covered herein to target
files that already exist.  Though they may not know whether they already
have notes covering the subject or whether they would need to write new
ones.  To this end, Denote provides two convenience commands:

‘denote-link-after-creating’
     Create new note in the background and link to it directly.

     Use ‘denote’ interactively to produce the new note.  Its doc string
     or this manual explains which prompts will be used and under what
     conditions (*note Standard note creation::).

     With optional ‘ID-ONLY’ as a prefix argument (this is the ‘C-u’
     key, by default) create a link that consists of just the
     identifier.  Else try to also include the file’s title.  This has
     the same meaning as in ‘denote-link’ (*note Adding a single
     link::).

     IMPORTANT NOTE: Normally, ‘denote’ does not save the buffer it
     produces for the new note.  This is a safety precaution to not
     write to disk unless the user wants it (e.g.  the user may choose
     to kill the buffer, thus cancelling the creation of the note).
     However, for this command the creation of the note happens in the
     background and the user may miss the step of saving their buffer.
     We thus have to save the buffer in order to (i) establish valid
     links, and (ii) retrieve whatever front matter from the target
     file.

‘denote-link-or-create’
     Use ‘denote-link’ on ‘TARGET’ file, creating it if necessary.

     If ‘TARGET’ file does not exist, call ‘denote-link-after-creating’
     which runs the ‘denote’ command interactively to create the file.
     The established link will then be targeting that new file.

     If ‘TARGET’ file does not exist, add the user input that was used
     to search for it to the history of the ‘denote-title-prompt’.  The
     user can then retrieve and possibly further edit their last input,
     using it as the newly created note’s actual title.  At the
     ‘denote-title-prompt’ type ‘M-p’ with the default key bindings,
     which calls ‘previous-history-element’.

     With optional ‘ID-ONLY’ as a prefix argument create a link with
     just the file’s identifier.  This has the same meaning as in
     ‘denote-link’.

     This command has the alias ‘denote-link-to-existing-or-new-note’,
     which helps with discoverability.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: The backlinks' buffer,  Next: Writing metanotes,  Prev: Link to an existing note or create a new one,  Up: Linking notes

6.6 The backlinks’ buffer
=========================

The command ‘denote-link-backlinks’ produces a bespoke buffer which
displays backlinks to the current note.  A “backlink” is a link back to
the present entry.

   By default, the backlinks’ buffer is desinged to display the file
name of the note linking to the current entry.  Each file name is
presented on its own line, like this:

     Backlinks to "On being honest" (20220614T130812)
     ------------------------------------------------

     20220614T145606--let-this-glance-become-a-stare__journal.txt
     20220616T182958--feeling-butterflies-in-your-stomach__journal.txt

   When the user option ‘denote-backlinks-show-context’ is non-nil, the
backlinks’ buffer displays the line on which a link to the current note
occurs.  It also shows multiple occurances, if present.  It looks like
this (and has the appropriate fontification):

     Backlinks to "On being honest" (20220614T130812)
     ------------------------------------------------

     20220614T145606--let-this-glance-become-a-stare__journal.txt
     37: growing into it: [[denote:20220614T130812][On being honest]].
     64: As I said in [[denote:20220614T130812][On being honest]] I have never
     20220616T182958--feeling-butterflies-in-your-stomach__journal.txt
     62: indifference.  In [[denote:20220614T130812][On being honest]] I alluded

   Note that the width of the lines in the context depends on the
underlying file.  In the above example, the lines are split at the
‘fill-column’.  Long lines will show up just fine.  Also note that the
built-in user option ‘xref-truncation-width’ can truncate long lines to
a given maximum number of characters.

   *note Speed up backlinks' buffer creation?::

   The backlinks’ buffer runs the major-mode ‘denote-backlinks-mode’.
It binds keys to move between links with ‘n’ (next) and ‘p’ (previous).
These are stored in the ‘denote-backlinks-mode-map’ (use ‘M-x
describe-mode’ (‘C-h m’) in an unfamiliar buffer to learn more about
it).  When the user option ‘denote-backlinks-show-context’ is non-nil,
all relevant Xref key bindings are fully functional: again, check
‘describe-mode’.

   The backlinking facility uses Emacs’ built-in Xref infrastructure.
On some operating systems, the user may need to add certain executables
to the relevant environment variable.

   *note Why do I get ``Search failed with status 1'' when I search for
backlinks?::

   Backlinks to the current file can also be visited by using the
minibuffer completion interface with the ‘denote-link-find-backlink’
command (*note Visiting linked files via the minibuffer::).

   The placement of the backlinks’ buffer is subject to the user option
‘denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action’.  Due to the nature of the
underlying ‘display-buffer’ mechanism, this inevitably is a relatively
advanced feature.  By default, the backlinks’ buffer is displayed below
the current window.  The doc string of our user option includes a sample
configuration that places the buffer in a left side window instead.
Reproducing it here for the sake of convenience:

     (setq denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action
           '((display-buffer-reuse-window
              display-buffer-in-side-window)
             (side . left)
             (slot . 99)
             (window-width . 0.3)))


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Writing metanotes,  Next: Visiting linked files via the minibuffer,  Prev: The backlinks' buffer,  Up: Linking notes

6.7 Writing metanotes
=====================

A “metanote” is an entry that describes other entries who have something
in common.  Writing metanotes can be part of a workflow where the user
periodically reviews their work in search of patterns and deeper
insights.  For example, you might want to read your journal entries from
the past year to reflect on your experiences, evolution as a person, and
the like.

   The commands ‘denote-link-add-links’,
‘denote-link-dired-marked-notes’ are suited for this task.

   *note Insert links matching a regexp::.

   *note Insert links from marked files in Dired::.

   You will create your metanote the way you use Denote ordinarily
(metanotes may have the ‘metanote’ keyword, among others), write an
introduction or however you want to go about it, invoke the command
which inserts multiple links at once (see the above-cited nodes), and
continue writing.

   Metanotes can serve as entry points to groupings of individual notes.
They are not the same as a filtered list of files, i.e.  what you would
do in Dired or the minibuffer where you narrow the list of notes to a
given query.  Metanotes contain the filtered list plus your thoughts
about it.  The act of purposefully grouping notes together and
contemplating on their shared patterns is what adds value.

   Your future self will appreciate metanotes for the function they
serve in encapsulating knowledge, while current you will be equipped
with the knowledge derived from the deliberate self-reflection.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Visiting linked files via the minibuffer,  Next: Miscellaneous information about links,  Prev: Writing metanotes,  Up: Linking notes

6.8 Visiting linked files via the minibuffer
============================================

Denote has a major-mode-agnostic mechanism to collect all linked file
references in the current buffer and return them as an appropriately
formatted list.  This list can then be used in interactive commands.
The ‘denote-link-find-file’ is such a command.  It uses minibuffer
completion to visit a file that is linked to from the current note.  The
candidates have the correct metadata, which is ideal for integration
with other standards-compliant tools (*note Extending Denote::).  For
instance, a package such as ‘marginalia’ will display accurate
annotations, while the ‘embark’ package will be able to work its magic
such as in exporting the list into a filtered Dired buffer (i.e.  a
familiar Dired listing with only the files of the current minibuffer
session).

   To visit backlinks to the current note via the minibuffer, use
‘denote-link-find-backlink’.  This is an alternative to placing
backlinks in a dedicated buffer (*note The backlinks' buffer::).


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Miscellaneous information about links,  Prev: Visiting linked files via the minibuffer,  Up: Linking notes

6.9 Miscellaneous information about links
=========================================

For convenience, the ‘denote-link’ command has an alias called
‘denote-link-insert-link’.  The ‘denote-link-backlinks’ can also be used
as ‘denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer’.  While ‘denote-link-add-links’
is aliased ‘denote-link-insert-links-matching-regexp’.  The purpose of
these aliases is to offer alternative, more descriptive names of select
commands.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Fontification in Dired,  Next: Use Org dynamic blocks,  Prev: Linking notes,  Up: Top

7 Fontification in Dired
************************

One of the upsides of Denote’s file-naming scheme is the predictable
pattern it establishes, which appears as a near-tabular presentation in
a listing of notes (i.e.  in Dired).  The ‘denote-dired-mode’ can help
enhance this impression, by fontifying the components of the file name
to make the date (identifier) and keywords stand out.

   There are two ways to set the mode.  Either use it for all
directories, which probably is not needed:

     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode)

   Or configure the user option ‘denote-dired-directories’ and then set
up the function ‘denote-dired-mode-in-directories’:

     ;; We use different ways to specify a path for demo purposes.
     (setq denote-dired-directories
           (list denote-directory
                 (thread-last denote-directory (expand-file-name "attachments"))
                 (expand-file-name "~/Documents/vlog")))

     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode-in-directories)

   The faces we define for this purpose are:

   • ‘denote-faces-date’
   • ‘denote-faces-delimiter’
   • ‘denote-faces-extension’
   • ‘denote-faces-keywords’
   • ‘denote-faces-subdirectory’
   • ‘denote-faces-time’
   • ‘denote-faces-title’

   For the time being, the ‘diredfl’ package is not compatible with this
facility.

   The ‘denote-dired-mode’ does not only fontify note files that were
created by Denote: it covers every file name that follows our naming
conventions (*note The file-naming scheme::).  This is particularly
useful for scenaria where, say, one wants to organise their collection
of PDFs and multimedia in a systematic way (and, perhaps, use them as
attachments for the notes Denote produces if you are writing Org notes
and are using its standand attachments’ facility).


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Use Org dynamic blocks,  Next: Minibuffer histories,  Prev: Fontification in Dired,  Up: Top

8 Use Org dynamic blocks
************************

Denote can optionally integrate with Org mode’s “dynamic blocks”
facility.  Start by loading the relevant library:

     ;; Register Denote's Org dynamic blocks
     (require 'denote-org-dblock)

   A dynamic block gets its contents by evaluating a given function,
depending on the type of block.  The type of block and its parameters
are stated in the opening ‘#+BEGIN’ line of the block.  Typing ‘C-c C-c’
with point on that line runs the function, with the given arguments, and
populates the block’s contents accordingly.

   Denote leverages Org dynamic blocks to streamline the inclusion of
(i) links to notes whose name matches a given search query (like
‘denote-link-add-links’) and (ii) backlinks to the current note (similar
to ‘denote-link-find-backlink’).

   These two types of blocks are named ‘denote-links’ and
‘denote-backlinks’ respectively.  The latter does not accept any
parameters, while the former does, which we explain below by also
demonstrating how dynamic blocks are written.

   A dynamic block looks like this:

     #+BEGIN: denote-links :regexp "_journal"

     #+END:

   Here we have the ‘denote-links’ type, with the ‘:regexp’ parameter.
The value of the ‘:regexp’ parameter is the same as that of the command
‘denote-link-add-links’ (*note Insert links matching a regexp::).  The
linked entry provides practical examples of patterns that make good use
of Denote’s file-naming scheme (*note The file-naming scheme::).

   In this example, we instruct Org to produce a list of all notes that
include the ‘journal’ keyword in their file name (keywords in file names
are prefixed with the underscore).  So the following:

     #+BEGIN: denote-links :regexp "_journal"

     #+END:

   Becomes something like this once we type ‘C-c C-c’ with point on the
‘#+BEGIN’ line (Org makes the links look prettier by default):

     #+BEGIN: denote-links :regexp "_journal"
     - [[denote:20220616T182958][Feeling butterflies in your stomach]]
     - [[denote:20220818T221036][Between friend and stranger]]
     #+END:

   The dynamic block takes care to keep the list in order and to add any
missing links when the block is evaluated anew.

   Depending on one’s workflow, the dynamic block can be instructed to
list only those links which are missing from the current buffer (similar
to ‘denote-link-add-missing-links’).  Adding the ‘:missing-only’
parameter with a non-‘nil’ value achieves this effect.  The ‘#+BEGIN’
line looks like this:

     #+BEGIN: denote-links :regexp "_journal" :missing-only t

   To reverse the order links appear in, add ‘:reverse t’ to the
‘#+BEGIN’ line.

   The ‘denote-links’ block can also accept a ‘:block-name’ parameter
with a string value that names the block.  Once the dynamic block is
evaluated, a ‘#+NAME’ is prepended to the block’s contents.  This can be
referenced in other source blocks to parse the named block’s contents as
input of another process.  The details are beyond the scope of Denote.

   As for the ‘denote-backlinks’ dynamic block type, it simply produces
a list of notes that link to the current file.  It accepts no parameters
and looks like this:

     #+BEGIN: denote-backlinks

     #+END:

   The Org manual describes the technicalities of Dynamic Blocks.
Evaluate:

     (info "(org) Dynamic Blocks")

   Dynamic blocks are particularly useful for metanote entries that
reflect on the status of earlier notes (*note Writing metanotes::).

9 Minibuffer histories
**********************

Denote has a dedicated minibuffer history for each one of its prompts.
This practically means that using ‘M-p’ (‘previous-history-element’) and
‘M-n’ (‘next-history-element’) will only cycle through the relevant
record of inputs, such as your latest titles in the ‘TITLE’ prompt, and
keywords in the ‘KEYWORDS’ prompt.

   The built-in ‘savehist’ library saves minibuffer histories.  Sample
configuration:

     (require 'savehist)
     (setq savehist-file (locate-user-emacs-file "savehist"))
     (setq history-length 500)
     (setq history-delete-duplicates t)
     (setq savehist-save-minibuffer-history t)

10.1 Keep a journal or diary
============================

While there are subtle technical differences between a journal and a
diary, we will consider those equivalent in the interest of brevity:
they both describe a personal space that holds a record of your thoughts
about your experiences and/or view of events in the world.

   Suppose you are committed to writing an entry every day.  Unlike what
we demonstrated before, your writing will follow a regular naming
pattern.  You know that the title of the new note must always look like
‘Tuesday 14 June 2022’ and the keyword has to be ‘journal’ or ‘diary’.
As such, you want to automate the task instead of being prompted each
time, as is the norm with ‘denote’ and the relevant commands (*note
Points of entry::).  This is easy to accomplish because ‘denote’ can be
called from Lisp and given the required arguments of ‘TITLE’ and
‘KEYWORDS’ directly.  All you need is a simple wrapper function:

     (defun my-denote-journal ()
       "Create an entry tagged 'journal' with the date as its title."
       (interactive)
       (denote
        (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y") ; format like Tuesday 14 June 2022
        '("journal"))) ; multiple keywords are a list of strings: '("one" "two")

   By invoking ‘my-denote-journal’ you will go straight into the newly
created note and commit to your writing outright.

   Of course, you can always set up the function so that it asks for a
‘TITLE’ but still automatically applies the ‘journal’ tag:

     (defun denote-journal-with-title ()
       "Create an entry tagged 'journal', while prompting for a title."
       (interactive)
       (denote
        (denote--title-prompt) ; ask for title, instead of using human-readable date
        '("journal")))

   Sometimes journaling is done with the intent to hone one’s writing
skills.  Perhaps you are learning a new language or wish to communicate
your ideas with greater clarity and precision.  As with everything that
requires a degree of sophistication, you have to work for it—write,
write, write!

   One way to test your progress is to set a timer.  It helps you gauge
your output and its quality.  To use a timer with Emacs, consider the
‘tmr’ package:

     (defun my-denote-journal-with-tmr ()
       "Like `my-denote-journal', but also set a 10-minute timer.
     The `tmr' command is part of the `tmr' package."
       (interactive)
       (denote
        (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y")
        '("journal"))
       (tmr "10" "Practice writing in my journal")) ; set 10 minute timer with a description

   Once the timer elapses, stop writing and review your performance.
Practice makes perfect!

   [ As Denote matures, we may add hooks to control what happens before
or after the creation of a new note.  We shall also document more
examples of tasks that can be accomplished with this package.  ]

10.2 Create a note with the region’s contents
=============================================

Sometimes it makes sense to gather notes in a single file and later
review it to make multiple notes out of it.  With the following code,
the user marks a region and then invokes the command
‘my-denote-create-new-note-from-region’: it prompts for a title and
keywords and then uses the region’s contents to fill in the newly
created note.

     (defun my-denote-create-new-note-from-region (beg end)
       "Create note whose contents include the text between BEG and END.
     Prompt for title and keywords of the new note."

10.3 Split an Org subtree into its own note
===========================================

With Org files in particular, it is common to have nested headings which
could be split off into their own standalone notes.  In Org parlance, an
entry with all its subheadings is a “subtree”.  With the following code,
the user places the point inside the heading they want to split off and
invokes the command ‘my-denote-org-extract-subtree’.  It will create a
note using the heading’s text and tags for the new file.  The contents
of the subtree become the contents of the new note and are removed from
the old one.

     (defun my-denote-org-extract-subtree ()

10.4 Narrow the list of files in Dired
======================================

Emacs’ standard file manager (or directory editor) can read a regular
expression to mark the matching files.  This is the command
‘dired-mark-files-regexp’, which is bound to ‘% m’ by default.  For
example, ‘% m _denote’ will match all files that have the ‘denote’
keyword (*note Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or
filtering::).

   Once the files are matched, the user has to options: (i) narrow the
list to the matching items or (ii) exclude the matching items from the
list.

   For the former, we want to toggle the marks by typing ‘t’ (calls the
command ‘dired-toggle-marks’ by default) and then hit the letter ‘k’
(for ‘dired-do-kill-lines’).  The remaining files are those that match
the regexp that was provided earlier.

   For the latter approach of filtering out the matching items, simply
involves the use of the ‘k’ command (‘dired-do-kill-lines’) to omit the
marked files from the list.

   These sequences can be combined to incrementally narrow the list.
Note that ‘dired-do-kill-lines’ does not delete files: it simply hides
them from the current view.

   Revert to the original listing with ‘g’ (‘revert-buffer’).

   For a convenient wrapper, consider this example:

     (defvar prot-dired--limit-hist '()
       "Minibuffer history for `prot-dired-limit-regexp'.")

     ;;;###autoload
     (defun prot-dired-limit-regexp (regexp omit)
       "Limit Dired to keep files matching REGEXP.

     With optional OMIT argument as a prefix (\\[universal-argument]),
     exclude files matching REGEXP.

     Restore the buffer with \\<dired-mode-map>`\\[revert-buffer]'."
       (interactive
        (list
         (read-regexp
          (concat "Files "
                  (when current-prefix-arg
                    (propertize "NOT " 'face 'warning))
                  "matching PATTERN: ")
          nil 'prot-dired--limit-hist)
         current-prefix-arg))
       (dired-mark-files-regexp regexp)
       (unless omit (dired-toggle-marks))
       (dired-do-kill-lines))

10.5 Use ‘dired-virtual-mode’ for arbitrary file listings
=========================================================

Emacs’ Dired is a powerful file manager that builds its functionality on
top of the Unix ‘ls’ command.  As noted elsewhere in this manual, the
user can update the ‘ls’ flags that Dired uses to display its contents
(*note I want to sort by last modified, why won’t Denote let me?: I want
to sort by last modified why won't Denote let me?.).

   What Dired cannot do is parse the output of a result that is produced
by piped commands, such as ‘ls -l | sort -t _ -k2’.  This specific
example targets the second underscore-separated field of the file name,
per our conventions (*note The file-naming scheme::).  Conceretely, it
matches the “alpha” as the sorting key in something like this:

     20220929T200432--testing-file-one__alpha.txt

   Consider then, how Dired will sort those files by their identifier:

     20220929T200432--testing-file-one__alpha.txt
     20220929T200532--testing-file-two__beta.txt
     20220929T200632--testing-file-three__alpha.txt
     20220929T200732--testing-file-four__beta.txt

   Whereas on the command line, we can get the following:

     $ ls | sort -t _ -k 2
     20220929T200432--testing-file-one__alpha.txt
     20220929T200632--testing-file-three__alpha.txt
     20220929T200532--testing-file-two__beta.txt
     20220929T200732--testing-file-four__beta.txt

   This is where ‘dired-virtual-mode’ shows its utility.  If we tweak
our command-line invocation to include ‘ls -l’, this mode can behave
like Dired on the listed files.  (We omit the output of the ‘-l’ flag
from this tutorial, as it is too verbose.)

   What we now need is to capture the output of ‘ls -l | sort -t _ -k 2’
in an Emacs buffer and then enable ‘dired-virtual-mode’.  To do that, we
can rely on either ‘M-x shell’ or ‘M-x eshell’ and then manually copy
the relevant contents.

   For the user’s convenience, I share what I have for Eshell to quickly
capture the last command’s output in a dedicated buffer:

     (defcustom prot-eshell-output-buffer "*Exported Eshell output*"
       "Name of buffer with the last output of Eshell command.
     Used by `prot-eshell-export'."
       :type 'string
       :group 'prot-eshell)

     (defcustom prot-eshell-output-delimiter "* * *"
       "Delimiter for successive `prot-eshell-export' outputs.
     This is formatted internally to have newline characters before
     and after it."
       :type 'string
       :group 'prot-eshell)

     (defun prot-eshell--command-prompt-output ()
       "Capture last command prompt and its output."
       (let ((beg (save-excursion
                    (goto-char (eshell-beginning-of-input))
                    (goto-char (point-at-bol)))))
         (when (derived-mode-p 'eshell-mode)
           (buffer-substring-no-properties beg (eshell-end-of-output)))))

     ;;;###autoload
     (defun prot-eshell-export ()
       "Produce a buffer with output of the last Eshell command.
     If `prot-eshell-output-buffer' does not exist, create it.  Else
     append to it, while separating multiple outputs with
     `prot-eshell-output-delimiter'."
       (interactive)
       (let ((eshell-output (prot-eshell--command-prompt-output)))
         (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create prot-eshell-output-buffer)
           (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
             (goto-char (point-max))
             (unless (eq (point-min) (point-max))
               (insert (format "\n%s\n\n" prot-eshell-output-delimiter)))
             (goto-char (point-at-bol))
             (insert eshell-output)
             (switch-to-buffer-other-window (current-buffer))))))

   Bind ‘prot-eshell-export’ to a key in the ‘eshell-mode-map’ and give
it a try (I use ‘C-c C-e’).  In the produced buffer, activate the
‘dired-virtual-mode’.

10.6 Use Embark to collect minibuffer candidates
================================================

‘embark’ is a remarkable package that lets you perform relevant,
context-dependent actions using a prefix key (simplifying in the
interest of brevity).

   For our purposes, Embark can be used to produce a Dired listing
directly from the minibuffer.  Suppose the current note has links to
three other notes.  You might use the ‘denote-link-find-file’ command to
pick one via the minibuffer.  But why not turn those three links into
their own Dired listing?  While in the minibuffer, invoke ‘embark-act’
which you may have already bound to ‘C-.’ and then follow it up with ‘E’
(for the ‘embark-export’ command).

   This pattern can be repeated with any list of candidates, meaning
that you can narrow the list by providing some input before eventually
exporting the results with Embark.

   Overall, this is very powerful and you might prefer it over doing the
same thing directly in Dired, since you also benefit from all the power
of the minibuffer (*note Narrow the list of files in Dired::).

10.7 Search file contents
=========================

Emacs provides built-in commands which are wrappers of standard Unix
tools: ‘M-x grep’ lets the user input the flags of a ‘grep’ call and
pass a regular expression to the ‘-e’ flag.

   The author of Denote uses this thin wrapper instead:

     (defvar prot-search--grep-hist '()
       "Input history of grep searches.")

     ;;;###autoload
     (defun prot-search-grep (regexp &optional recursive)
       "Run grep for REGEXP.

     Search in the current directory using `lgrep'.  With optional
     prefix argument (\\[universal-argument]) for RECURSIVE, run a
     search starting from the current directory with `rgrep'."
       (interactive
        (list
         (read-from-minibuffer (concat (if current-prefix-arg
                                           (propertize "Recursive" 'face 'warning)
                                         "Local")
                                       " grep for PATTERN: ")
                               nil nil nil 'prot-search--grep-hist)
         current-prefix-arg))
       (unless grep-command
         (grep-compute-defaults))
       (if recursive
           (rgrep regexp "*" default-directory)
         (lgrep regexp "*" default-directory)))

   Rather than maintain custom code, consider using the excellent
‘consult’ package: it provides commands such as ‘consult-grep’ and
‘consult-find’ which provide live results and are generally easier to
use than the built-in commands.

10.8 Bookmark the directory with the notes
==========================================

Part of the reason Denote does not reinvent existing functionality is to
encourage you to learn more about Emacs.  You do not need a bespoke
“jump to my notes” directory because such commands do not scale well.
Will you have a “jump to my downloads” then another for multimedia and
so on?  No.

   Emacs has a built-in framework for recording persistent markers to
locations.  Visit the ‘denote-directory’ (or any dir/file for that
matter) and invoke the ‘bookmark-set’ command (bound to ‘C-x r m’ by
default).  It lets you create a bookmark.

   The list of bookmarks can be reviewed with the ‘bookmark-bmenu-list’
command (bound to ‘C-x r l’ by default).  A minibuffer interface is
available with ‘bookmark-jump’ (‘C-x r b’).

   If you use the ‘consult’ package, its default ‘consult-buffer’
command has the means to group together buffers, recent files, and
bookmarks.  Each of those types can be narrowed to with a prefix key.
The package ‘consult-dir’ is an extension to ‘consult’ which provides
useful extras for working with directories, including bookmarks.

10.9 Use the ‘citar-denote’ package for bibliography notes
==========================================================

Peter Prevos has produced the ‘citar-denote’ package which makes it
possible to write notes on BibTeX entries with the help of the ‘citar’
package.  These notes have the citation’s unique key associated with
them in the file’s front matter.  They also get a configurable keyword
in their file name, making it easy to find them in Dired and/or retrieve
them with the various Denote methods.

   With ‘citar-denote’, the user leverages standard minibuffer
completion mechanisms (e.g.  with the help of the ‘vertico’ and ‘embark’
packages) to manage bibliographic notes and access those notes with
ease.  The package’s documentation covers the details:
<https://github.com/pprevos/citar-denote/>.

10.10 Use the ‘consult-notes’ package
=====================================

If you are already using ‘consult’ (which is a brilliant package), you
will probably like its ‘consult-notes’ extension.  It uses the familiar
mechanisms of Consult to filter searches via a prefix key.  For example:

     (setq consult-notes-sources
           `(("Notes"  ?n ,denote-directory)
             ("Books"  ?b "~/Documents/books")))

   With the above, ‘M-x consult-notes’ will list the files in those two
directories.  If you type ‘n’ and space, it narrows the list to just the
notes, while ‘b’ does the same for books.

   To search all your notes with grep (or ripgrep if installed – see
‘consult-notes-use-rg’ variable) use the command
‘consult-notes-search-in-all-notes’.  This will employ grep/ripgrep for
searching terms in all the directories set in ‘consult-notes-sources’.

   Note that ‘consult-notes’ is in its early stages of development.
Expect improvements in the near future (written on 2022-06-22 16:48
+0300).

10.11 Treat your notes as a project
===================================

Emacs has a built-in library for treating a directory tree as a
“project”.  This means that the contents of this tree are seen as part
of the same set, so commands like ‘project-switch-to-buffer’ (‘C-x p b’
by default) will only consider buffers in the current project (e.g.
three notes that are currently being visited).

   Normally, a “project” is a directory tree whose root is under version
control.  For our purposes, all you need is to navigate to the
‘denote-directory’ (for the shell or via Dired) and use the command-line
to run this (requires the ‘git’ executable):

     git init

   From Dired, you can type ‘M-!’ which invokes
‘dired-smart-shell-command’ and then run the git call there.

   The project can then be registered by invoking any project-related
command inside of it, such as ‘project-find-file’ (‘C-x p f’).

   It is a good idea to keep your notes under version control, as that
gives you a history of changes for each file.  We shall not delve into
the technicalities here, though suffice to note that Emacs’ built-in
version control framework or the exceptionally well-crafted ‘magit’
package will get the job done (VC can work with other backends besides
Git).

10.12 Variants of ‘denote-open-or-create’
=========================================

The command ‘denote-open-or-create’ prompts to visit a file in the
‘denote-directory’.  If the user input does not have any matches,
‘denote-open-or-create’ will call the ‘denote’ command interactively.
It will then use whatever prompts ‘denote’ normally has, per the user
option ‘denote-prompts’ (*note Standard note creation::).

workflow, we provide these ready-to-use commands that one can add to
their Emacs init file.  They can be assigned to key bindings or be used

10.13 Variants of ‘denote-link-or-create’
=========================================

The command ‘denote-link-or-create’ uses ‘denote-link’ on a ‘TARGET’
file, creating it if necessary.  The ‘TARGET’ matches the user input at
a minibuffer prompt: it is a file in the ‘denote-directory’.

   If ‘TARGET’ file does not exist, The ‘denote-link-or-create’ calls
‘denote-link-after-creating’ which runs the standard ‘denote’ command
interactively to create the file (*note Standard note creation::).  The
established link will then be targeting that new file.

   When called with an optional prefix argument (‘C-u’ by default)
‘denote-link-or-create’ creates a link that consists of just the
identifier.  Else it tries to also include the file’s title.  This has
the same meaning as in ‘denote-link’ (*note Linking notes::).

   To speed up the process or to maintain variants that suit one’s
workflow, we provide these ready-to-use commands that one can add to
their Emacs init file.  They can be assigned to key bindings or be used
via ‘M-x’ after they have been evaluated.

11.2 Manual installation
========================

Assuming your Emacs files are found in ‘~/.emacs.d/’, execute the
following commands in a shell prompt:

     cd ~/.emacs.d

     # Create a directory for manually-installed packages
     mkdir manual-packages

     # Go to the new directory
     cd manual-packages

     # Clone this repo, naming it "denote"
     git clone https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote denote

   Finally, in your ‘init.el’ (or equivalent) evaluate this:

     ;; Make Elisp files in that directory available to the user.
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/denote")

   Everything is in place to set up the package.

13 For developers or advanced users
***********************************

Denote is in a stable state and can be relied upon as the basis for
custom extensions.  Further below is a list with the functions or
variables we provide for public usage.  Those are in addition to all
user options and commands that are already documented in the various
sections of this manual.

   In this context “public” is any form with single hyphens in its
symbol, such as ‘denote-directory-files’.  We expressly support those,
meaning that we consider them reliable and commit to documenting any
changes in their particularities (such as through ‘make-obsolete’, a
record in the change log, a blog post on the maintainer’s website, and
the like).

   By contradistinction, a “private” form is declared with two hyphens
in its symbol such as ‘denote--file-extension’.  Do not use those as we
might change them without further notice.

Variable ‘denote-id-format’
     Format of ID prefix of a note’s filename.  The note’s ID is derived
     from the date and time of its creation (*note The file-naming
     scheme::).

Variable ‘denote-id-regexp’
     Regular expression to match ‘denote-id-format’.

Variable ‘denote-title-regexp’
     Regular expression to match the TITLE field in a file name (*note
     The file-naming scheme::).

Variable ‘denote-keywords-regexp’
     Regular expression to match the KEYWORDS field in a file name
     (*note The file-naming scheme::).

Variable ‘denote-excluded-punctuation-regexp’
     Punctionation that is removed from file names.  We consider those
     characters illegal for our purposes.

Variable ‘denote-excluded-punctuation-extra-regexp’
     Additional punctuation that is removed from file names.  This
     variable is for advanced users who need to extend the
     ‘denote-excluded-punctuation-regexp’.  Once we have a better
     understanding of what we should be omitting, we will update things
     accordingly.

Function ‘denote-file-is-note-p’
     Return non-nil if ‘FILE’ is an actual Denote note.  For our
     purposes, a note must not be a directory, must satisfy
     ‘file-regular-p’, its path must be part of the variable
     ‘denote-directory’, it must have a Denote identifier in its name,
     and use one of the extensions implied by ‘denote-file-type’.

Function ‘denote-file-has-identifier-p’
     Return non-nil if ‘FILE’ has a Denote identifier.

Function ‘denote-file-has-supported-extension-p’
     Return non-nil if ‘FILE’ has supported extension.  Also account for
     the possibility of an added ‘.gpg’ suffix.  Supported extensions
     are those implied by ‘denote-file-type’.

Function ‘denote-file-is-writable-and-supported-p’
     Return non-nil if ‘FILE’ is writable and has supported extension.

Function ‘denote-keywords’
     Return appropriate list of keyword candidates.  If
     ‘denote-infer-keywords’ is non-nil, infer keywords from existing
     notes and combine them into a list with ‘denote-known-keywords’.
     Else use only the latter set of keywords (*note Standard note
     creation::).

Function ‘denote-keywords-sort’
     Sort ‘KEYWORDS’ if ‘denote-sort-keywords’ is non-nil.  ‘KEYWORDS’
     is a list of strings, per ‘denote-keywords-prompt’.

Function ‘denote-directory’
     Return path of the variable ‘denote-directory’ as a proper
     directory, also because it accepts a directory-local value for what
     we internally refer to as “silos” (*note Maintain separate
     directories for notes: Maintain separate directory silos for
     notes.).

Function ‘denote-directory-files’
     Return list of absolute file paths in variable ‘denote-directory’.
     Files only need to have an identifier.  The return value may thus
     include file types that are not implied by ‘denote-file-type’.  To
     limit the return value to text files, use the function
     ‘denote-directory-text-only-files’.  Remember that the
     ‘denote-directory’ accepts a directory-local value (*note Maintain
     separate directories for notes: Maintain separate directory silos
     for notes.).

Function ‘denote-directory-text-only-files’
     Return list of text files in variable ‘denote-directory’.  Filter
     ‘denote-directory-files’ using ‘denote-file-is-note-p’.

Function ‘denote-directory-subdirectories’
     Return list of subdirectories in variable ‘denote-directory’.  Omit
     dotfiles (such as .git) unconditionally.  Also exclude whatever
     matches ‘denote-excluded-directories-regexp’.  Note that the
     ‘denote-directory’ accepts a directory-local value for what we call
     “silos” (*note Maintain separate directories for notes: Maintain
     separate directory silos for notes.).

Function ‘denote-directory-files-matching-regexp’
     Return list of files matching ‘REGEXP’ in ‘denote-directory-files’.

Function ‘denote-file-name-relative-to-denote-directory’
     Return name of ‘FILE’ relative to the variable ‘denote-directory’.
     ‘FILE’ must be an absolute path.

Function ‘denote-get-path-by-id’
     Return absolute path of ‘ID’ string in ‘denote-directory-files’.

Function ‘denote-barf-duplicate-id’
     Throw a ‘user-error’ if ‘IDENTIFIER’ already exists.

Function ‘denote-sluggify’
     Make ‘STR’ an appropriate slug for file names and related (*note
     Sluggified title and keywords::).

Function ‘denote-sluggify-and-join’
     Sluggify ‘STR’ while joining separate words.

Function ‘denote-desluggify’
     Upcase first char in ‘STR’ and dehyphenate ‘STR’, inverting
     ‘denote-sluggify’.  Basically, convert ‘this-is-a-test’ to ‘This is
     a test’.

Function ‘denote-sluggify-keywords’
     Sluggify ‘KEYWORDS’, which is a list of strings (*note Sluggified
     title and keywords::).

Function ‘denote-filetype-heuristics’
     Return likely file type of ‘FILE’.  Use the file extension to
     detect the file type of the file.

     If more than one file type correspond to this file extension, use
     the first file type for which the key-title-kegexp matches in the
     file or, if none matches, use the first type with this file
     extension in ‘denote-file-type’.

     If no file types in ‘denote-file-types’ has the file extension, the
     file type is assumed to be the first of ‘denote-file-types’.

Function ‘denote-format-file-name’
     Format file name.  ‘PATH’, ‘ID’, ‘KEYWORDS’, ‘TITLE-SLUG’ are
     expected to be supplied by ‘denote’ or equivalent: they will all be
     converted into a single string.  ‘EXTENSION’ is the file type
     extension, as a string.

Function ‘denote-extract-keywords-from-path’
     Extract keywords from ‘PATH’ and return them as a list of strings.
     ‘PATH’ must be a Denote-style file name where keywords are prefixed
     with an underscore.  If ‘PATH’ has no such keywords, which is
     possible, return nil (*note The file-naming scheme::).

Function ‘denote-extract-id-from-string’
     Return existing Denote identifier in ‘STRING’, else nil.

Function ‘denote-retrieve-filename-identifier’
     Extract identifier from ‘FILE’ name.  To return an existing
     identifier or create a new one, refer to the
     ‘denote-retrieve-or-create-file-identifier’ function.

Function ‘denote-retrieve-or-create-file-identifier’
     Return ‘FILE’ identifier, generating one if appropriate.  The
     conditions are as follows:

        • If ‘FILE’ has an identifier, return it.

        • If ‘FILE’ does not have an identifier and optional ‘DATE’ is
          non-nil, invoke ‘denote-prompt-for-date-return-id’.

        • If ‘FILE’ does not have an identifier and DATE is nil, use the
          file attributes to determine the last modified date and format
          it as an identifier.

        • As a fallback, derive an identifier from the current time.

     To only return an existing identifier, refer to the function
     ‘denote-retrieve-filename-identifier’.

Function ‘denote-retrieve-filename-title’
     Extract title from ‘FILE’ name, else return ‘file-name-base’.  Run
     ‘denote-desluggify’ on the title if the extraction is successful.

Function ‘denote-retrieve-title-value’
     Return title value from ‘FILE’ front matter per ‘FILE-TYPE’.

Function ‘denote-retrieve-title-line’
     Return title line from ‘FILE’ front matter per ‘FILE-TYPE’.

Function ‘denote-retrieve-keywords-value’
     Return keywords value from ‘FILE’ front matter per ‘FILE-TYPE’.

Function ‘denote-retrieve-keywords-line’
     Return keywords line from ‘FILE’ front matter per ‘FILE-TYPE’.

Function ‘denote-file-prompt’
     Prompt for file with identifier in variable ‘denote-directory’.
     With optional ‘INITIAL-TEXT’, use it to prepopulate the minibuffer.

Function ‘denote-keywords-prompt’
     Prompt for one or more keywords.  In the case of multiple entries,
     those are separated by the ‘crm-sepator’, which typically is a
     comma.  In such a scenario, the output is sorted with
     ‘string-lessp’.  To sort the return value, use
     ‘denote-keywords-sort’.

Function ‘denote-title-prompt’
     Read file title for ‘denote’.  With optional ‘DEFAULT-TITLE’ use it
     as the default value.

Function ‘denote-file-type-prompt’
     Prompt for ‘denote-file-type’.  Note that a non-nil value other
     than ‘text’, ‘markdown-yaml’, and ‘markdown-toml’ falls back to an
     Org file type.  We use ‘org’ here for clarity.

Function ‘denote-date-prompt’
     Prompt for date, expecting ‘YYYY-MM-DD’ or that plus ‘HH:MM’ (or
     even ‘HH:MM:SS’).  Use Org’s more advanced date selection utility
     if the user option ‘denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date’ is
     non-nil.  It requires Org (*note The
     denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option: The
     denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option.).

Function ‘denote-prompt-for-date-return-id’
     Use ‘denote-date-prompt’ and return it as ‘denote-id-format’.

Function ‘denote-template-prompt’
     Prompt for template key in ‘denote-templates’ and return its value.

Function ‘denote-subdirectory-prompt’
     Prompt for subdirectory of the variable ‘denote-directory’.  The
     table uses the ‘file’ completion category (so it works with
     packages such as ‘marginalia’ and ‘embark’).

Function ‘denote-rename-file-prompt’
     Prompt to rename file named ‘OLD-NAME’ to ‘NEW-NAME’.

Function ‘denote-rename-file-and-buffer’
     Rename file named ‘OLD-NAME’ to ‘NEW-NAME’, updating buffer name.

Function ‘denote-update-dired-buffers’
     Update Dired buffers of variable ‘denote-directory’.  Note that the
     ‘denote-directory’ accepts a directory-local value for what we
     internally refer to as “silos” (*note Maintain separate directories
     for notes: Maintain separate directory silos for notes.).

Variable ‘denote-file-types’
     Alist of ‘denote-file-type’ and their format properties.

     Each element is of the form ‘(SYMBOL PROPERTY-LIST)’.  ‘SYMBOL’ is
     one of those specified in ‘denote-file-type’ or an arbitrary symbol
     that defines a new file type.

     ‘PROPERTY-LIST’ is a plist that consists of eight elements:

       1. ‘:extension’ is a string with the file extension including the
          period.

       2. ‘:date-function’ is a function that can format a date.  See
          the functions ‘denote--date-iso-8601’, ‘denote--date-rfc3339’,
          and ‘denote--date-org-timestamp’.

       3. ‘:front-matter’ is either a string passed to ‘format’ or a
          variable holding such a string.  The ‘format’ function accepts
          four arguments, which come from ‘denote’ in this order:
          ‘TITLE’, ‘DATE’, ‘KEYWORDS’, ‘IDENTIFIER’.  Read the doc
          string of ‘format’ on how to reorder arguments.

       4. ‘:title-key-regexp’ is a regular expression that is used to
          retrieve the title line in a file.  The first line matching
          this regexp is considered the title line.

       5. ‘:title-value-function’ is the function used to format the raw
          title string for inclusion in the front matter (e.g.  to
          surround it with quotes).  Use the ‘identity’ function if no
          further processing is required.

       6. ‘:title-value-reverse-function’ is the function used to
          retrieve the raw title string from the front matter.  It
          performs the reverse of ‘:title-value-function’.

       7. ‘:keywords-key-regexp’ is a regular expression used to
          retrieve the keywords’ line in the file.  The first line
          matching this regexp is considered the keywords’ line.

       8. ‘:keywords-value-function’ is the function used to format the
          keywords’ list of strings as a single string, with appropriate
          delimiters, for inclusion in the front matter.

       9. ‘:keywords-value-reverse-function’ is the function used to
          retrieve the keywords’ value from the front matter.  It
          performs the reverse of the ‘:keywords-value-function’.

       10. ‘:link’ is a string, or variable holding a string, that
          specifies the format of a link.  See the variables
          ‘denote-org-link-format’, ‘denote-md-link-format’.

       11. ‘:link-in-context-regexp’ is a regular expression that is
          used to match the aforementioned link format.  See the
          variables ‘denote-org-link-in-context-regexp’,
          ‘denote-md-link-in-context-regexp’.

     If ‘denote-file-type’ is nil, use the first element of this list
     for new note creation.  The default is ‘org’.

Variable ‘denote-org-front-matter’
     Specifies the Org front matter.  It is passed to ‘format’ with
     arguments ‘TITLE’, ‘DATE’, ‘KEYWORDS’, ‘ID’ (*note Change the front
     matter format::)

Variable ‘denote-yaml-front-matter’
     Specifies the YAML (Markdown) front matter.  It is passed to
     ‘format’ with arguments ‘TITLE’, ‘DATE’, ‘KEYWORDS’, ‘ID’ (*note

15 Things to do
***************

Denote should work well for what is described in this manual.  Though we
can always do better.  This is a non-exhaustive list with some
low-priority ideas you may want to help with (*note Contributing::).

   • Support mutually-exclusive sets of tags.  For example, a ‘home’
     keyword would preclude ‘work’.  Personally, I am not a fan of such
     arrangements as there may be a case where something applies to both
     ends of this prefigured binary.  Though we can think about it.

   • Add command that expands the identifier in links to a full file
     name.  This would be useful for some sort of “export” operation
     where the absolute file path is necessary and where the Denote
     linking mechanism is not available.  Though this could be handled
     by the exporter, by doing something like what
     ‘denote-link-find-file’ does.

   • Add command that rewrites full names in links, if they are invalid.
     This would complement the renaming mechanism.  Personally, I think
     old titles in links are not a problem, because they show you what
     was true at the time and are usually relevant to their context.
     Again though, it is an option worth exploring.

   • Ensure integration between ‘denote:’ links and the ‘embark’
     package.  The idea is to allow Embark to understand the Denote
     buttons are links to files and correctly infer the absolute path.
     I am not sure what a user would want to do with this, but maybe
     there are some interesting possibilities.

   You are welcome to suggest more ideas.  If they do not broaden the
scope of Denote, they can be added to denote.el.  Otherwise we might
think of extensions to the core package.

17 Alternatives to Denote
*************************

What follows is a list of Emacs packages for note-taking.  I
(Protesilaos) have not used any of them, as I was manually applying my
file-naming scheme beforehand and by the time those packages were
available I was already hacking on the predecessor of Denote as a means
of learning Emacs Lisp (a package which I called “Unassuming Sidenotes
of Little Significance”, aka “USLS” which is pronounced as “U-S-L-S” or
“useless”).  As such, I cannot comment at length on the differences
between Denote and each of those packages, beside what I gather from
their documentation.

org-roam (https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam)
     The de facto standard in the Emacs milieu—and rightly so!  It has a
     massive community, is featureful, and should be an excellent
     companion to anyone who is invested in the Org ecosystem and/or
     knows what “Roam” is (I don’t).  It has been explained to me that
     Org Roam uses a database to store a cache about your notes.  It
     otherwise uses standard Org files.  The cache helps refer to the
     same node through aliases which can provide lots of options.
     Personally, I follow a single-topic-per-note approach, so anything
     beyond that is overkill.  If the database is only for a cache, then
     maybe that has no downside, though I am careful with any kind of
     specialised program as it creates a dependency.  If you ask me
     about database software in particular, I have no idea how to use
     one, let alone debug it or retrieve data from it if something goes
     awry (I could learn, but that is beside the point).

zk (or zk.el) (https://github.com/localauthor/zk)
     Reading its documentation makes me think that this is Denote’s
     sibling—the two projects have a lot of things in common, including
     the preference to rely on plain files and standard tools.  The core
     difference is that Denote has a strict file-naming scheme.  Other
     differences in available features are, in principle, matters of
     style or circumstance: both packages can have them.  As its
     initials imply, ZK enables a zettelkasten-like workflow.  It does
     not enforce it though, letting the user adapt the method to their
     needs and requirements.

zettelkasten (https://github.com/ymherklotz/emacs-zettelkasten)
     This is another one of Denote’s relatives, at least insofar as the
     goal of simplicity is concerned.  The major difference is that
     according to its documentation “the name of the file that is
     created is just a unique ID”.  This is not consistent with our
     file-naming scheme which is all about making sense of your files by
     their name alone and being able to visually parse a listing of them
     without any kind of specialised tool (e.g.  ‘ls -l’ or ‘ls -C’ on
     the command-line from inside the ‘denote-directory’ give you a
     human-readable set of files names, while ‘find * -maxdepth 0 -type
     f’ is another approach).

zetteldeft (https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft)
     This is a zettelkasten note-taking system built on top of the
     ‘deft’ package.  Deft provides a search interface to a directory,
     in this case the one holding the user’s ‘zetteldeft’ notes.  Denote
     has no such dependency and is not opinionated about how the user
     prefers to search/access their notes: use Dired, Grep, the
     ‘consult’ package, or whatever else you already have set up for all
     things Emacs, not just your notes.

   Searching through ‘M-x list-packages’ for “zettel” brings up more
matches.  ‘zetteldesk’ is an extension to Org Roam and, as such, I
cannot possibly know what Org Roam truly misses and what the added-value
of this package is.  ‘neuron-mode’ builds on top of an external program
called ‘neuron’, which I have never used.

   Searching for “note” gives us a few more results.  ‘notes-mode’ has
precious little documentation and I cannot tell what it actually does
(as I said in my presentation for LibrePlanet 2022, inadequate docs are
a bug).  ‘side-notes’ differs from what we try to do with Denote, as it
basically gives you the means to record your thoughts about some other
project you are working on and keep them on the side: so it and Denote
should not be mutually exclusive.

   If I missed something, please let me know.

File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Why develop Denote when PACKAGE already exists?,  Next: Why not rely exclusively on Org?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

18.1 Why develop Denote when PACKAGE already exists?
====================================================

I wrote Denote because I was using a variant of Denote’s file-naming
scheme before I was even an Emacs user (I switched to Emacs from
Tmux+Vim+CLI in the summer of 2019).  I was originally inspired by
Jekyll, the static site generator, which I started using for my website
in 2016 (was on WordPress before).  Jekyll’s files follow the
‘YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md’ pattern.  I liked its efficiency relative to the
unstructured mess I had before.  Eventually, I started using that scheme
outside the confines of my website’s source code.  Over time I refined
it and here we are.

   Note-taking is something I take very seriously, as I am a prolific
writer (just check my website, which only reveals the tip of the
iceberg).  As such, I need a program that does exactly what I want and
which I know how to extend.  I originally tried to use Org capture
templates to create new files with a Denote-style file-naming scheme but
never managed to achieve it.  Maybe because ‘org-capture’ has some
hard-coded assumptions or I simply am not competent enough to hack on
core Org facilities.  Whatever the case, an alternative was in order.

   The existence of PACKAGE is never a good reason for me not to conduct
my own experiments for recreational, educational, or practical purposes.
When the question arises of “why not contribute to PACKAGE instead?” the
answer is that without me experimenting in the first place, I would lack
the skills for such a task.  Furthermore, contributing to another
package does not guarantee I get what I want in terms of workflow.

   Whether you should use Denote or not is another matter altogether:
choose whatever you want.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Why not rely exclusively on Org?,  Next: Why care about Unix tools when you use Emacs?,  Prev: Why develop Denote when PACKAGE already exists?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

18.2 Why not rely exclusively on Org?
=====================================

I think Org is one of Emacs’ killer apps.  I also believe it is not the
right tool for every job.  When I write notes, I want to focus on
writing.  Nothing more.  I thus have no need for stuff like org-babel,
scheduling to-do items, clocking time, and so on.  The more “mental
dependencies” you add to your workflow, the heavier the burden you carry
and the less focused you are on the task at hand: there is always that
temptation to tweak the markup, tinker with some syntactic construct,
obsess about what ought to be irrelevant to writing as such.

   In technical terms, I also am not fond of Org’s code base (I
understand why it is the way it is—just commenting on the fact).  Ever
tried to read it?  You will routinely find functions that are
tens-to-hundreds of lines long and have all sorts of special casing.  As
I am not a programmer and only learnt to write Elisp through trial and
error, I have no confidence in my ability to make Org do what I want at
that level, hence ‘denote’ instead of ‘org-denote’ or something.

   Perhaps the master programmer is one who can deal with complexity and
keep adding to it.  I am of the opposite view, as language—code
included—is at its communicative best when it is clear and accessible.

   Make no mistake: I use Org for the agenda and also to write technical
documentation that needs to be exported to various formats, including
this very manual.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Why care about Unix tools when you use Emacs?,  Next: Why many small files instead of few large ones?,  Prev: Why not rely exclusively on Org?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

18.3 Why care about Unix tools when you use Emacs?
==================================================

My notes form part of my longer-term storage.  I do not want to have to
rely on a special program to be able to read them or filter them.  Unix
is universal, at least as far as I am concerned.

   Denote streamlines some tasks and makes things easier in general,
which is consistent with how Emacs provides a layer of interactivity on
top of Unix.  Still, Denote’s utilities can, in principle, be
implemented as POSIX shell scripts (minus the Emacs-specific parts like
fontification in Dired or the buttonization of links).

   Portability matters.  For example, in the future I might own a
smartphone, so I prefer not to require Emacs, Org, or some other
executable to access my files on the go.

   Furthermore, I might want to share those files with someone.  If I
make Emacs a requirement, I am limiting my circle to a handful of
relatively advanced users.

   Please don’t misinterpret this: I am using Emacs full-time for my
computing and maintain a growing list of packages for it.  This is just
me thinking long-term.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Why many small files instead of few large ones?,  Next: Does Denote perform well at scale?,  Prev: Why care about Unix tools when you use Emacs?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

18.4 Why many small files instead of few large ones?
====================================================

I have read that Org favours the latter method.  If true, I strongly
disagree with it because of the implicit dependency it introduces and
the way it favours machine-friendliness over human-readability in terms
of accessing information.  Notes are long-term storage.  I might want to
access them on (i) some device with limited features, (ii) print on
paper, (iii) share with another person who is not a tech wizard.

   There are good arguments for few large files, but all either
prioritize machine-friendliness or presuppose the use of sophisticated
tools like Emacs+Org.

   Good luck using ‘less’ on a generic TTY to read a file with a zillion
words, headings, sub-headings, sub-sub-headings, property drawers, and
other constructs!  You will not get the otherwise wonderful folding of
headings the way you do in Emacs—do not take such features for granted.

   My point is that notes should be atomic to help the user—and
potentially the user’s family, friends, acquaintances—make sense of them
in a wide range of scenaria.  The more program-agnostic your file is,
the better for you and/or everyone else you might share your writings
with.

   Human-readability means that we optimize for what matters to us.  If
(a) you are the only one who will ever read your notes, (b) always have
access to good software like Emacs+Org, (c) do not care about printing
on paper, then Denote’s model is not for you.  Maybe you need to tweak
some ‘org-capture’ template to append a new entry to one mega file (I do
that for my Org agenda, by the way, as I explained before about using
the right tool for the job).


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: Does Denote perform well at scale?,  Next: I add TODOs to my notes; will many files slow down the Org agenda?,  Prev: Why many small files instead of few large ones?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

18.5 Does Denote perform well at scale?
=======================================

Denote does not do anything fancy and has no special requirements: it
uses standard tools to accomplish ordinary tasks.  If Emacs can cope
with lots of files, then that is all you need to know: Denote will work.

   To put this to the test, Peter Prevos is running simulations with R
that generate large volumes of notes.  You can read the technicalities
here: <https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/testing-denote-package/>.
Excerpt:

     Using this code I generated ten thousands notes and used this to
     test the Denote package to see it if works at a large scale.  This
     tests shows that Prot’s approach is perfectly capable of working
     with thousands of notes.

   Of course, we are always prepared to make refinements to the code,
where necessary, without compromising on the project’s principles.


File: docvTU8YZ.info,  Node: I add TODOs to my notes; will many files slow down the Org agenda?,  Next: I want to sort by last modified why won't Denote let me?,  Prev: Does Denote perform well at scale?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

18.6 I add TODOs to my notes; will many files slow down the Org agenda?
=======================================================================

Yes, many files will slow down the agenda due to how that works.  Org
collects all files specified in the ‘org-agenda-files’, searches through
their contents for timestamped entries, and then loops through all days
to determine where each entry belongs.  The more days and more files,
the longer it takes to build the agenda.  Doing this with potentially
hundreds of files will have a noticeable impact on performance.

   This is not a deficiency of Denote.  It happens with generic Org
files.  The way the agenda is built is heavily favoring the use of a
single file that holds all your timestamped entries (or at least a few
such files).  Tens or hundreds of files are inefficient for this job.
Plus doing so has the side-effect of making Emacs open all those files,
which you probably do not need.

   If you want my opinion though, be more forceful with the separation
of concerns.  Decouple your knowledge base from your ephemeral to-do
list: Denote (and others) can be used for the former, while you let
standard Org work splendidly for the latter—that is what I do, anyway.

   Org has a powerful linking facility, whether you use ‘org-store-link’
or do it via an ‘org-capture’ template.  If you want a certain note to
be associated with a task, just store the task in a single ‘tasks.org’
(or however you name it) and link to the relevant context.

   Do not mix your knowledge base with your to-do items.  If you need
help figuring out the specifics of this workflow, you are welcome to ask
for help in our relevant channels (*note Contributing::).

18.7 I want to sort by last modified, why won’t Denote let me?
==============================================================

Denote does not sort files and will not reinvent tools that handle such
functionality.  This is the job of the file manager or command-line
executable that lists files.

   I encourage you to read the manpage of the ‘ls’ executable.  It will
help you in general, while it applies to Emacs as well via Dired.  The
gist is that you can update the ‘ls’ flags that Dired uses on-the-fly:
type ‘C-u M-x dired-sort-toggle-or-edit’ (‘C-u s’ by default) and append
‘--sort=time’ at the prompt.  To reverse the order, add the ‘-r’ flag.
The user option ‘dired-listing-switches’ sets your default preference.

   There is also “virtual Dired” if you need something that cannot be

18.8 How do you handle the last modified case?
==============================================

Denote does not insert any meta data or heading pertaining to edits in
the file.  I am of the view that these either do not scale well or are
not descriptive enough.  Suppose you use a “lastmod” heading with a
timestamp: which lines where edited and what did the change amount to?

   This is where an external program can be helpful.  Use a Version
Control System, such as Git, to keep track of all your notes.  Every
time you add a new file, record the addition.  Same for post-creation
edits.  Your VCS will let you review the history of those changes.  For
instance, Emacs’ built-in version control framework has a command that
produces a log of changes for the current file: ‘M-x vc-print-log’,
bound to ‘C-x v l’ by default.  From there one can access the
corresponding diff output (use ‘M-x describe-mode’ (‘C-h m’) in an
unfamiliar buffer to learn more about it).  With Git in particular,
Emacs users have the option of the all-round excellent ‘magit’ package.

   In short: let Denote (or equivalent) create notes and link between
them, the file manager organise and provide access to files, search
programs deal with searching and narrowing, and version control software
handle the tracking of changes.

18.9 Speed up backlinks’ buffer creation?
=========================================

Denotes leverages the built-in ‘xref’ library to search for the
identifier of the current file and return any links to it.  For users of
Emacs version 28 or higher, there exists a user option to specify the
program that performs this search: ‘xref-search-program’.  The default
is ‘grep’, which can be slow, though one may opt for ‘ugrep’, ‘ripgrep’,
or even specify something else (read the doc string of that user option
for the details).

   Try either for these for better results:

     (setq xref-search-program 'ripgrep)

     ;; OR

     (setq xref-search-program 'ugrep)

   To use whatever executable is available on your system, use something
like this:

     ;; Prefer ripgrep, then ugrep, and fall back to regular grep.
     (setq xref-search-program
           (cond
            ((or (executable-find "ripgrep")
                 (executable-find "rg"))
             'ripgrep)
            ((executable-find "ugrep")
             'ugrep)
            (t
             'grep)))

18.10 Why do I get “Search failed with status 1” when I search for backlinks?
=============================================================================

Denote uses *note Emacs’ Xref: (emacs)Xref. to find backlinks.  Xref
requires ‘xargs’ and one of ‘grep’ or ‘ripgrep’, depending on your
configuration.

   This is usually not an issue on *nix systems, but the necessary
executables are not available on Windows Emacs distributions.  Please
ensure that you have both ‘xargs’ and either ‘grep’ or ‘ripgrep’
available within your ‘PATH’ environment variable.

   If you have ‘git’ on Windows installed, then you may use the
following code (adjust the git’s installation path if necessary):
     (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ";" "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin"))

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,

====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
