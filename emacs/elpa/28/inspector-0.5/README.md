## Installation

This package is available from ELPA.

`M-x package-install RET inspector RET`

## Usage

### Invocation

* `M-x inspect-expression` to evaluate an elisp expression and inspect the result.
* `M-x inspect-last-sexp` to evaluate last sexp in current buffer and inspect the result.

### Inside the inspector

* `M-x inspector-pop` bound to letter `l`, to navigate to previous object.
* `M-x inspector-quit` bound to letter `q`, to exit the inspector.

Also, `M-x forward-button` and `M-x backward-button` are conveniently bound to `n` and `p`. 
They can be used for fast navigation across the buttons that the inspector displays.

Finally, you can use `M-x eval-expression` bound to letter `e`, to evaluate an elisp expression using the object currently being inspected (it is bound to `*`).

### From the Emacs debugger

When on an Emacs debugging backtrace, press letter `i` to inspect the pointed frame and its local variables.

When on edebug-mode, use `C-c C-i` for inspecting expressions in the debugger.
