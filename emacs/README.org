* Emacs configuration

Notes on this configuration:


** Initial setup

- symlink ~${HOME}/.emacs.d~ to ~emacs~


** Conventions

- private functions have the prefix ~/~, e.g. ~/lisp-mode-hook~
- advice functions should be named after the function they are advising, e.g., ~(advice-add 'mouse-set-point :around #'/mouse-set-point)~
